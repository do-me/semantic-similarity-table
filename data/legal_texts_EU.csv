Making use of the knowledge and technologies developed by this programme will make it possible to meet a wide range of social and economic needs so reconciling economic development with environmental sustainability. New markets will bring growth and employment; reliable and competitive supply of energy will be ensured and energy requirements will be met. The results will provide the basis for policies formulated at Community level or deriving from international environmental commitments - in particular, the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol requires urgent support for RTD on a number of issues.This programme will encourage integrated multidisciplinary approaches seeking to solve problems with a European dimension for which scientific and technological developments are needed. People are a key interactive component of the ecosystem and, therefore, a fair balance between scientific and socioeconomic disciplines must be found in project implementation.Harnessing the full spectrum of these RTD activities, ranging from basic research to demonstration projects, and using all suitable instruments, including supporting proposals spanning the spectrum of RTD activities, are envisaged to tackle the major issues at stake, in order to meet the need for a better understanding of natural processes and patterns and the interactions with human activities through to the development of new technologies and instruments ensuring further steps towards sustainable development.Although research and technological development in the field of environment and energy are closely related, they remain distinct areas. For this reason, they will be implemented through two subprogrammes, 'Environment and sustainable development` and 'Energy`, each with its own budget and programme committee. Exchange of information between the two committees will be ensured as appropriate.Strategic objective of the programmeThe strategic goal is to contribute to sustainable development by focusing on key activities crucial for social well-being and economic competitiveness in Europe.An innovative approach based on two main elements will make it possible to address complex social-driven issues: integrated multidisciplinary and multisectoral activities involving wherever possible the principal stakeholders, private-public sector partnerships, and end-users from the business, industrial and policy-making sectors, and concentrating on finding solutions to strategic problems, and supporting only proposals which are of substantive regional, European and global significance. Europe has established a leading RTD role in many areas - this must be sustained and remain at the cutting-edge. In other areas improvements are needed for the future benefit of society, as well as the business and industrial sectors.Social objectives. Society is making increasing demands for better living conditions, better safety, and better use of scarce resources including secure and economic energy supplies and services. Availability of a sufficient and economic energy supply must be assured to promote industrial competitiveness and to maintain the quality of life for Europe's citizens. At the same time, the environmental impact of energy production and use must be reduced. Water is of economic, environmental and social strategic value. Rising population and per-capita use of resources, globalisation of economic markets and natural variability in earth systems are causing or exacerbating major environmental problems. The sea is essential for trade and transport in Europe, a source of numerous resources and a major resource for tourism, but it is also the ultimate repository for many by-products of human activity. Cities together with their cultural heritage are the centre of social, cultural and economic life for 80 % of Europe's citizens. These key societal issues will only be solved if in addition to developing technologies the socioeconomic context is appropriately analysed and taken into account.European added-value and subsidiarity. Environmental problems, energy systems, networks and services and the associated environmental impacts, as well as sustainable development issues must be approached in the global context. In this respect, the European level is the most appropriate: most problems and challenges are common to all Member States and most activities to be addressed in the programme are not only European, but also global, in scale. By mobilising resources and focusing on key targets, the programme will form a key part of the European contribution to global initiatives and programmes. Knowledge generated through collaborative RTD at the European level, together with the coordination of fragmented European knowledge, is essential to address the very serious problems facing the Union. These efforts, including prenormative research, will confer genuine European added-value to the efforts to develop appropriate regulatory frameworks, for example in the post-Kyoto process.Economic development and scientific and technological prospects. The promotion of sustainable development will not be possible unless economic objectives relating to technological development, competitiveness and growth are reconciled with societal goals such as quality of life, employment, security, health and a high quality environment. This challenge must be met in the context of significant structural and demographic changes, and globalisation of the economy. Improving our quality of life and decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation will contribute to European competitiveness and employment. Secure and economic energy supplies and services are vital for all aspects of economic activity. The need for energy equipment suppliers and operators to be competitive in the global market is vital for employment. Enormous potential will exist for global exploitation from several areas of the programme, strengthening economic competitiveness and creating new jobs, such as in the water industry, renewable energy technologies, rational use of energy and reuse of resources, as well as technologies to improve energy efficiency and the water and/or energy industries.LINKS AND COMPLEMENTARITY WITH THE OTHER PROGRAMMESCollaboration, coordination and complementarity will be fostered within and between key actions in this and other programmes, including the activities of the JRC. This is of particular significance here given the Community's commitments on integrating environment protection requirements into other policy areas. Coordination with other thematic programmes will be based on the following principles: activities in the quality of life and management of living resources programme will concentrate on epidemiology research arising from environmental and climate changes, whereas this programme will focus on the consequences for human health from climate change; activities within the information society programme will concentrate on the development of information society technologies, and activities in this programme on the integration and adaptation of these technologies in applications; and activities in the programme for promoting competitive and sustainable growth will concentrate on the design and development of materials and technologies for generic use and treatment of industrial waste within the production centre but in this programme the activities will concentrate on the integration, application and demonstration of technologies and materials for energy or urban use, including their design and development where specifically needed for urban or cultural heritage use and the management of industrial waste outside the production centre.Major examples of collaboration with key actions in other programmes where action to avoid duplication is essential will be found with health, food and environmental factors (climate change and air pollution), sustainable agriculture and fisheries (marine ecosystems), systems and services for the citizen (earth observation technologies and energy distribution networks), land transport and marine technologies (marine ecosystems, transport and offshore hydrocarbon exploitation), sustainable mobility and intermodality (urban environment) and innovative products, processes and organisation of production (urban waste, materials and industrial processes). Complementarity and coordination will also be assured with the horizontal activities of the framework programme.- Global international cooperation with international organisations and the scientific, business and industrial communities from third countries is inescapable to address many cross-border environmental issues central to implementing international conventions and programmes, as well as the environmental consequences of energy policies and cross-border supply interdependency. Close links will be maintained with the pre-accession States to collaborate on tackling some of the research needed to meet common challenges and common objectives corresponding to the programme priorities and as such will be open to third country and international organisations. The focus will continue to be fields of mutual concern and cooperation, particularly on global change and related issues through the development and implementation of mechanisms such as the European network for research on global change. There will also be coordination with the programme 'Confirming the international role of Community research` which will address activities of specific regional relevance to the third countries concerned. Legal entities from third countries and international organisations may participate in this programme according to the priorities set out herewith, in line with the objectives outlined in the programme 'Confirming the international role of Community research` and with the rules for participation and dissemination. Full use will be made of the possibilities offered by COST and Eureka and by cooperation with international organisations to foster synergy between actions and projects in this programme and nationally funded research activities. In the case of cooperation with Eureka, projects corresponding to themes of common interest with the framework programme may be developed in the context of the key actions, in conformity with the selection criteria and procedures of the framework programme,- Activities related to innovation and participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will be given a particular emphasis to help bridge the gap between research results and their effective exploitation in potential applications by the business and policy-making sectors. The participation of SMEs in all RTD activities will be stimulated and encouraged. Their important potential to contribute to the innovation process is fully recognised. Exploratory awards will be available to facilitate the participation of SMEs in collaborative RTD, as well as in cooperative RTD in the case of SMEs without relevant research facilities of their own. An 'innovation unit` will target promotion activities on the deployment and use of the results of this programme; it will also help to ensure complementarity and an interface with the innovation activities implemented in the context of the programme on innovation and participation of SMEs,- Improving the know-how, skills and qualifications of European researchers and the understanding of the socioeconomic impact of research in the fields covered by this programme is essential to ensure sufficient availability of appropriate expertise and to establish tangible and lasting impacts. Training and socioeconomic research will therefore form an integral part of this programme, complemented by appropriate links with the horizontal programme 'Improving the human research potential and the socioeconomic knowledge base`. Training activities in this programme will include support to fellowships, which will take the form of Marie Curie fellowships following the definitions and rules set out in the horizontal programme, and advanced study and specialised courses.A. ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTThe strategic goal of this part of the programme is to promote environmental science and technology so as to improve our quality of life and boost growth, competitiveness and employment, while meeting the need for sustainable management of resources and protection of the environment in line with the goals and objectives of the fifth action programme on the environment as well as other Community policies relating to the environment.The RTD and demonstration projects will concentrate through four key actions on tackling the issues of sustainable water management and water quality; global change, climate and biodiversity; sustainable integrated management of marine resources; and city of tomorrow and cultural heritage as well as generic activities concerning the fight against major hazards, the development of earth observation technologies, and socioeconomic aspects of environment within the perspective of sustainable development (the impact on society, the economy and employment). Specific attention will also be given to the need for an optimum use of existing European research infrastructures and for transnational cooperation in the rational and cost-effective development of European research infrastructures to support cutting-edge research in environmental activities.(a) KEY ACTIONS(i) Sustainable management and quality of waterObjectives and RTD prioritiesThe overall goal of this key action is to produce the knowledge and technologies needed for the rational management of water resources, for tackling important problems such as water scarcity, and for networks for domestic needs and those of industry and agriculture, while maintaining the integrity of ecosystems. Research will focus on:- Development of treatment and purification technologies to prevent pollution, to purify water, to prevent and mitigate salination of water resources and to use and/or reuse water rationally as well as the development of an integrated approach for the management of water resources and wetlandsThe aim is to develop the knowledge and the technologies needed for the rational management of water resources; to match water supply with demand and achieve cost-efficiency and sustainability; to improve the science base (including on habits, attitudes and cultural patterns), methodologies and management tools to provide a better understanding of the phenomena and allow integrated management and sustainable use of water and wetlands at catchment scale, within constraints of availability, environmental quality and socioeconomic cost-benefits; to develop technologies to prevent and treat pollution of water bodies and groundwater stocks, to purify water and to use and/or reuse water rationally (including closed loop approaches and reliability of collection and distribution networks).RTD priorities: tools and methodologies for cost-effective and sustainable integrated water resources and wetlands management; effective transfer of knowledge and skills to water users; development of real scale applications across Europe with a view to supporting EU policy; optimisation of technologies to treat and purify drinking water and to minimise use and pollution of water; process-integrated treatment of waste water at source; rational reuse of water; application of closed loop technologies; development of integrated procedures to assess the state of water systems; development of advanced processes to prevent and alleviate salination,- Technologies for monitoring and prevention of pollution, protection and management of groundwater and surface water resources, including ecological quality aspectsThe aim is to characterise and to assess the state and evolution of the quality and quantity of surface and groundwaters as well as the functioning of aquatic and wetland ecosystems as the basis for more rational management. This will include the development of technologies for assessing and treating pollution originating from contaminated sites and waste disposal sites as well as the development of biological assessment methods for monitoring water quality.RTD priorities: improved methods of measuring and monitoring water quality and quantity and techniques for analysing pollutant flows and development of technologies for integrated assessment of soil pollution treatment methods; nutrients from diffuse sources; predictive models and advanced pollution impact assessment methodologies; updated water quality criteria and indicators for water policies,- Surveillance, early warning and communication systemsThe aim is to develop systems able to react on different time and space scales, including early-warning predictive systems with direct feedback to pollution sources.RTD priorities: surveillance systems for point and diffuse pollution sources and for the various environmental recipient systems; control and data management systems, including leakage detection and stormwater management and systems for floods and drought assessment,- Technologies for the regulation and management of stocks and technologies for arid and semi-arid regions and generally water-deficient regionsThe aim is to improve and protect water resources and aquatic ecosystems, to optimise water management systems in arid regions, and to better manage water crises.RTD priorities: integrated approaches at catchment and collection point level incorporating the various political, social, economic and environmental interactions; improved systems for management of water resources and their use at EU, national, regional and local level to assist decision making.(ii) Global change, climate and biodiversityObjectives and RTD prioritiesThe aim of this key action is to develop the scientific, technological and socioeconomic basis and tools necessary for the study and understanding of changes in the environment.

THE MISSION OF JRCThe mission of JRC is to provide customer-driven scientific and technical support for the conception, development, implementation and monitoring of Community policies. As a service of the European Commission, the JRC functions as a reference centre of science and technology for the Community. Close to the policy-making process, it serves the common interest of the Member States, while being independent of commercial or national interests.Carrying out specific high-level research in close contact with industry and other bodies, the JRC supports the policy-maker in addressing the concerns of the individual citizen, improving the interaction between man and the environment and promoting sustainable development.In implementing its mission, the JRC will endeavour to coordinate RTD activities carried out in the Member States. Its work depends on intensive networking with public and private institutions in the Member States through, for example, research networks, joint projects or staff exchanges. This is important because the JRC's mission is complementary to the indirect action part of the fifth framework programme; while the indirect actions will continue to be the main mechanism for developing and testing new ideas, the JRC's role is to help apply them in the service of the policy-maker.B. OBJECTIVE: SUPPORT THE MANAGEMENT OF CHANGEProgress in technology, especially in the life sciences and information technology, is changing the way we live, the way we do business and the world we live in. These changes are complex and interrelated so those involved with policy need support in understanding how to harness the technologies to provide better services to the citizen, to allow industry to take advantage of new opportunities and to promote policies that protect the citizen from the risks that accompany the benefits of such changes. JRC, as the scientific arm of the Commission, must be able to underpin the management of change by supporting the Community policy-making process through: facilitating a better understanding of emerging issues; providing scientific and technical support to the elaboration and implementation of policies; providing realistic monitoring of the effectiveness of policy measures.The two selection criteria for JRC activities are:- relevance to Community policies. An understanding of the policy agenda allows JRC research to be timely and support the formulation of policy where it is most needed,- subsidiarity. This has two aspects. Firstly the research must be in an area where Community involvement is appropriate and secondly it should be appropriate for this involvement to be through the JRC. Thus JRC operates in areas such as cross-border issues, consumer protection and anti-fraud where its unique pan-European identity provides an added-value.C. THE JRC PROGRAMMEJRC's specific programme for the fifth framework programme reflects the large changes that have taken place in Europe and the wider world in the past 10 years. While these changes have all been beneficial for growth and prosperity, care is needed to ensure that the growth continues, that European industry can compete on a fair basis within the internal market and on the wider world market, that the growth is sustainable and that Europe's citizens can live in a clean and safe environment.Accordingly JRC's programme has been divided into three main themes:I. Serving the citizenII. Enhancing sustainabilityIII. Underpinning European competitivenessThe objective of the first theme is to provide support to policy that protects individual citizens. This includes measures to give the consumer confidence that the food he or she eats or buys is identified and labelled correctly, that he or she is protected against fraud, that he or she can fully utilise the benefits of modern medicine, that the information that he or she receives is dependable and that he or she is protected against natural and man-made hazards.The second main theme is sustainability; achieving growth while protecting the environment, conserving natural resources, maintaining biodiversity and ensuring that the Community can continue funding the relevant policies and avoiding that efforts in these regards are not undermined by fraud. It is a major Community policy objective that environmental considerations be integrated into all other policies and framing legislation that achieves this integration while maintaining a broad free market policy is a major challenge to legislators. JRC will support sustainability through analysis of the environmental impact of policy options, through support to anti-fraud measures in the agriculture and fishery policies, through support to the international effort to prevent global change and through the study of how European ecosystems are changing and could be preserved.The main objective of the third theme is to contribute to the Community's industrial competitiveness policy by supporting the transfer of knowledge and research results from the scientific community to industrial users. The JRC will for example exploit its specific expertise to facilitate the utilisation of the latest technologies by emerging industries, such as earth observation and advanced materials (e.g. biomaterials). Other appropriate actions will be taken to support key policy areas such as enlargement and integration of candidate countries into a common internal market, pre-accession and EU-Mediterranean cooperation, where further efforts are required to optimise potential synergies between the scientific and industrial communities of the EU and its partner countries.Two horizontal elements run through all three JRC research themes. The first of these, measurements, standards and testing, constitutes one of the key specialities of the JRC. The second is a techno-economic intelligence that can provide EU institutions with timely advice concerning the development of new technologies, the likelihood of breakthroughs, the social challenges that they pose and their possible impact on policy. This includes monitoring developments in the other major industrialised trading blocs to determine what lessons can be learned. Both these tasks are generic to all JRC activities - even where not explicitly mentioned.Finally the programme which follows should not to be considered a rigid blueprint for the work programme of JRC over the next four years but rather a general outline that reflects the current view of the policy agenda and its priorities. Changes to the JRC programme are to be expected as science and technology advance and as the policy agenda and the priorities of the customer change.I. SERVING THE CITIZENThe first theme of JRC's research is centred on the citizen. The objective is to support those Community policies that are intended to protect him or her, provide him or her with information, maintain his or her health and protect his or her safety.Consumer policy and consumer health protection are most important factors in Community policy and, in fact, the legal basis for consumer protection will be further strengthened by the Amsterdam Treaty. The main objectives of the policy are to protect the consumer in the internal market; to reinforce market transparency; to improve consumer confidence, especially by more complete and effective information and education; develop a system of dialogue and consultation between the European Commission and organisations representing consumers, and improve the dialogue between the latter and industry; and to ensure that the interests of the consumer are given due consideration in the development of other Community policies. The JRC will provide scientific support for this policy.Along with biotechnology, information technology is the fastest moving technology and the EC's information society initiative, while recognising that progress is driven by market forces, ensures that policy fully takes advantages of the benefits of the technology and that individuals can depend on information that has been processed securely. The JRC will support the initiative through technical advice on dependable services and improving the ease of access to information.The third thrust of the JRC's effort in services to the citizens is in health. The objective here is to exploit specific technologies where the JRC has unique technologies and expertise for the diagnosis and treatment of disease.Beside safety of food and feed products, Community measures to protect the safety of citizens include, among others, car safety legislation, directives on industrial safety and construction guidelines. The JRC will provide a technical backup to these measures, determine how new technologies can help cope with natural disasters with a cross-border dimension, such as flooding, and contribute to the Union effort on civilian de-mining through appropriate coordination and support activities.I.1. Consumer protectionFor consumer health EC institutions manage scientific committees whose work is based on excellence, independence and transparency; carry out inspections to ensure that rules of hygiene and food safety are respected; and evaluate and assess possible risks to consumer health.This marked strengthening of consumer policy has been prompted by the general desire to match, on the one hand, the rapid growth in the possibilities offered by advanced technologies to increase the variety and lower the costs of products in the market by, on the other hand, adequate measures to protect consumers. It is clear that a strong scientific support to this policy is required, both to understand the complex issues involved and to apply the latest technology for checking the quality and origins of products. The JRC will support Community policy in this area by applying emerging technologies for consumer protection measures and will be ready to assess and react to new hazards as they occur. This work will involve:- research to underpin the harmonisation and validation of methods for quality and safety analysis of feeding stuffs, including possible European harmonisation of standards for organic foods, and for animal feedstuffs, food, beverages, and consumer products; provision of references for the determination of food and beverages authenticity and origin, for the establishment of inspection practices and for risk-assessment; methods and references in support of food-labelling and development of anti-fraud techniques,- support to the implementation of Community policy on biotechnology including methods for the monitoring and detection of genetically modified organisms and risk-assessment studies,- toxicological studies on the impact and health effects of diverse food contaminants, toxic chemicals (e.g. endocrine disrupters) and pathogenic micro-organisms; establishment of models and procedures for risk-assessment,- validation of safe alternative procedures to in-vivo experiments currently used to determine the toxicological hazards posed by chemicals, pharmaceuticals and consumer products.I.2. Medical and health applicationsSeveral JRC generated technologies related to nuclear engineering, metrology, informatics and material sciences have potential applications in the area of medicine and healthcare and are sufficiently mature for further development. The implementation of this work will rely on the use of JRC facilities and unique expertise, and will continue to be carried out in networks together with the medical and pharmaceutical communities. It will include:- active support, including validation and standardisation, to development of anti-cancer therapies based on nuclear technologies, applications of boron neutron capture therapies and alpha-immuno therapies and to medical imaging,- prenormative research and validation of testing methods for bio-compatible materials and bio-mechanical components; qualification of certain medical equipment for the harmonisation of norms and standards; development, production and certification of reference materials for clinical diagnostics and validation of testing instruments,- support to telematics systems for the secure exchange of regulatory information on pharmaceuticals in the EC.I.3. Benefiting from the information societyThe JRC's information technology expertise will be used to support dependability aspects of the EC's information society initiative and to strengthen fraud control measures. The work includes:- support to the dependability initiative including defined tests and tools of reliability, research on systems' survivability, dependability characterisation of services and qualification procedures for embedded systems; application and demonstration of emerging networking technologies, decision support systems and medical data systems; use of research results in statistical and geographic information applications,- support to anti-fraud measures including the development and operation of effective, reliable and safe communication systems amongst public authorities in Member States and the Commission, development of an early-warning system and methods for analysis and control of large quantities of information from different sources.I.4. Safety of the citizen: man-made hazards and natural hazardsThe EC has a number of measures to protect individuals against hazards. These include standards in car construction, high pressure equipment, obligations on the labelling and notification of dangerous chemicals and the notification of accidents. The JRC plays an active part in the implementation of these policies and in support for the development of new safety measures:- support of Community industrial safety regulations through analysis of industrial accident data, supply of information to the competent authorities and industry and technical advice to the Commission,- design, development, validation and harmonisation of inspection procedures for high pressure equipment, with a view to provide maximum safety at the work place; support to the development and implementation of new standards. Interactions of hydrogen with structural materials and preparation of industrial safety norms and standards,- monitoring, control and management of chemical products: implementation and improvement of regulations for the notification, authorisation, classification and labelling of new and existing chemicals; research on environmental risk-assessment,- maintenance and further development of a research platform contributing to the scientific and technical basis needed for civilian land de-mining operations; compilation of an index of mine types and their signatures; development of strategies for examining mine fields and establishing secure detection and destruction methods; establishment of reference criteria and standards and validation of clearing methods and available devices,- chemical characterisation and tools for the determination of the origin of illicit drugs,- characterisation of the structural safety of transport vehicles and crash barriers; calibration of test facilities in the Member States together with the validation of simulation methods intended to complement traditional impact tests,- support to the establishment of a common European reporting system for in-flight incidents including analysis of the influence of human error,- support to the formulation and development of construction standards (Eurocodes); research to ensure safety and reliability of buildings and civil engineering structures against seismic movements, rapid impacts and traffic vibrations including applications for the preservation of significant monuments for the European cultural heritage, assessment of their degradation and techniques for their restoration,- applications of earth observation techniques for the risk and damage assessment, monitoring and post-crisis management of natural hazards such as forest fires, floods, landslides, droughts, and coastal storms.II. ENHANCING SUSTAINABILITYTechnological development, sustainable growth, respect and care for the environment are key issues for the Community, enshrined in the Treaty and pursued through common policies and actions.The Community's fifth environmental action programme (1992 to 2000) forms the basis of environment policy of the EC and describes the challenge of the 1990s as making progress towards sustainable development. A recently published action plan identifies five priority areas where Community action needs to be stepped up. These are firstly improved integration of the environment into other policies such as agriculture, transport, energy, industry and tourism; secondly the use of a wider range of instruments, especially market based instruments but also structural policy, to implement Community policy; thirdly improving the implementation and enforcement of Community legislation; fourthly a raising of public awareness; and lastly a raising of the Union's profile in international affairs - strengthening cooperation with central and east European countries and the Mediterranean partnership countries, enhancing the EU's role in international environmental actions and dealing with trade and environmental issues.The JRC's scientific and technical services will provide the expertise necessary to help in the understanding of the issues involved and to support the implementation of all five points of the action plan. Its broad range of disciplines will contribute to the establishment of sound and feasible limits for pollutants, the production of commonly accepted reference materials and measurements for monitoring them, the determination of the impact of proposed legislation, the identification of the best available technologies and the assessment of available scientific knowledge for improving industrial processes and reduce pollution, the understanding of global climate change processes and their impact, the identification of new technologies that could affect sustainability. Particular efforts will be made in the energy and transport sectors.The JRC research aimed at enhancing sustainability will provide support to the Commission, the European Parliament, the Member States and relevant EU agencies, and will include the following targeted issues.II.1. Integration of environmental protection in other Community policiesThe Commission is obliged by the Treaty to assess the consequences of any proposal that has an impact on the environment and to endeavour to integrate sustainability objectives into all sectoral policies such as agriculture, energy, transport and regional development. The JRC will support this effort through:- socio- and techno-economic studies to improve the integration of environmental protection in sectoral Community policies, including case studies and development of methods to measure and analyse regulatory instruments (e.g. 'green accounting`),- research on land cover and land use dynamics, regional and urban development trends; research on agro-environmental issues mainly using earth observation; coastal zone management, development and harmonisation of indicators of environmental degradation.II.2. PollutionCommunity legislation requires that new industrial developments use the best available techniques in order to reduce pollution in an integrated manner, i.e., to take account of all forms of pollution, air, soil and water. As a support to this and all other pollution control management measures it is a prerequisite that systems be developed for detecting pollutants and that measurements throughout the Community be harmonised. The JRC's work will therefore involve:- support to environmental legislation for integrated (e.g. water, air, soil) pollution prevention and control in industry; development of the reference framework for the use of best available techniques in several industrial sectors; assessment of the impact of legislation on competitiveness and employment,- support to the international harmonisation of pollution-monitoring techniques; development and production of reference materials and measurements in different materials (e.g. soil, water, air, biota, etc.) for pollution control,- research to underpin the harmonisation and validation of reference methods for the analysis of water quality, water monitoring, water treatment and water management; assessment of toxicological risks posed by water pollutants; interventions in emergency cases; procedures and criteria for water quality control; studies on water management practices and their impacts in geographical areas protected by EC legislation and in those prone to flooding and drought,- development of techniques for localisation of soil contamination due to industrial activities and to monitor marine pollution events (e.g. algae blooms, oil spills) including the detection of vessels causing pollution,- research to underpin harmonisation and validation of air quality control methods and criteria for air quality in urban and 'conurban` areas; impact of alternative fuels on air quality and emissions of micro-particles; surveillance of radioactivity in the environment; regional programmes for environmental monitoring of selected regions (e.g. the Alpine Convention).II.3. Global changeBy signing the Kyoto Protocol, industrialised nations have committed themselves to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union, which negotiated on behalf of the Member States, has promised to reduce emissions to 8 % below 1990 levels. The European Union needs strong technical support in order to maintain credibility as a party to the Climate Convention, strengthen its position on the international scene, understand possible futures for Europe including implications for managed and unmanaged natural resources, public health and biodiversity, highlight risks and uncertainties and formulate appropriate policy. The JRC will support Community policy by:- study on the fluxes of greenhouse gases and aerosols; research on the processes leading to greenhouse emissions; assessment of the consequences of the Kyoto Protocol on emission levels, air quality, climatic change and the European economy; support to European political initiatives,- exploitation of Earth observation for mapping, monitoring and making an inventory of key global, marine and terrestrial resources. Global information systems and models will support the analysis and understanding of observed trends. Access to global datasets will be provided to European research networks.II.4. Energy and transportThe final consumption of energy in Europe is divided almost equally between industry (29 %), transport (32 %) and the household and tertiary sectors (39 %). The majority of this is from fossil fuel with petroleum products dominating the transport sector and almost two thirds of all coal being used for the production of electricity. Only by effective measures to reduce emissions and replace fossil fuels with renewable energies can Europe respect international agreements and achieve sustainable growth. The 1996 Green Paper on renewable energy found that the EC Treaty offered ample scope for promoting renewable energy and suggested that the Community reinforce its policy in order to achieve a target 12 % of gross inland energy consumption by 2010. The JRC will support Community policy through:"

These tasks imply the following activities: (a) the development of common classifications, methods and definitions that are directly applicable in all the Member States and backed by Communiy legislation; (b) the conduct of common statistical surveys based on harmonized methods; (c) preparation, analysis and dissemination of Community statistics, including comparisons from country-by-country and region-by-region comparisons; (d) incorporation of Community know-how into the statistical programmes of the Member States; (e) promotion of convergence in national statistical practices by means of common training activities; (f) support for the development of the statistical systems of both Community and non-Community countries via structural activities and exchanges of technology and experience between the Member States and with third countries. LINKS WITH OTHER ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT UNDER COOPERATION ARRANGEMENTS Apart from the partnership with the national statistical systems of the Member States, cooperation will also extend to the systems in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries which form part of the European Economic Area (EEA), as well as to international organizations active in the statistical field, particularly the United Nations and its agencies and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). SECTORAL STATISTICAL PROGRAMMES I. SECTORAL PROGRAMMES FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF THE SINGLE MARKET A. Sectoral programmes for policy on industry, transport, energy, R & D and tourism Purpose To contribute to the preparation of statistics necessary for the proper functioning of the European Single Market by providing decision-makers (government, businesses and social partners) with the information they require to promote competitiveness of the Community economy at international level, at the same time improving market transparency. Statistical objectives To propose to the Member States the harmonization of standards, the execution of Community statistical surveys, common processing of existing data, and the introduction of common statistical infrastructures utilizing existing data where possible, such as the registers in the following fields. 1. Standards All the statistical programmes will incorporate new European classifications which are harmonized to a high degree with national classifications, thus providing a true common data framework for all the sectors of activity in the Community. 2. Statistics of trade in goods between Member States This project is aimed at implementing the Council decisions concerning the exchange of goods between Member States after 1992 subsequent to abolition of border controls within the Community. The Comext-93 distributed database, containing trade and tariff statistics for the Community and non-Community countries, will result in new more detailed and more up-to-date statistics thanks to the distribution of processing operations. Providing these detailed data to the institutions and economic agents will be facilitated by the general use of new information technology media, mainly CD-ROM, by an output which is more suited to the major sectors of activity and by matching the disseminated product to the declaring systems; this in turn will make for improved feed-back and greater market transparency. The quality of the statistics and their up-to-date character depend directly on the usefulness businesses attach to them and on the cost-benefit ratio of the declaration; consequently, in addition to the efforts to reduce the general workload, promotion and training campaigns will be stepped up to improve the response rates. The combination of trade and tariff data, the greater coordination between production and trade statistics, the extension of geographic coverage to the EFTA countries and comparisons with third country data will be the main thrusts of future development. 3. Statistics on enterprises (a) Industry The main objective of Statistics on enterprises is to provide all the information necessary for monitoring the Community production system and for monitoring the Commission's sectoral policy. The operational consequences for the Statistical Programme 1993 to 1997, as they result from the EEC Treaty, as amended by the Maastricht Treaty, involve both standardization (adoption of joint methods, classifications and standards), infrastructure aspects (technical and legal), the extension of Community surveys to cover new ground, and human and budgetary resources. The main objective remains the improvement of the three mainstays of these statistics: annual data on structure and activity, sufficiently detailed monitoring of business cycles and sufficient details for monitoring the production of goods and services. The introduction of an annual survey on the structure and activity of enterprises will lead to data broken down by activity sectors, size classes, Member States or their regions. The statistics on the production of goods and services will form the basis of all work on monitoring and improving the transparency of the internal market (commercial policy, competitiveness). Beyond this central objective, two major categories of work will be continued or developed. First, all ways and means will be studied to achieve improved industrial statistics which will lessen the load on the enterprises surveyed but also improve the possibilities for them to use the information (further standardization work, coordination of surveys with the enterprises, dialogue with them to adapt the information to their needs, etc.). Second, specific developments are called for by new Community policies: - development of the information system for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) specific indicators, particularly in demography or characteristics which are unique to the SMEs, - design and introduction of detailed indicators of the competitiveness of European enterprises which also permit comparisons with their competitors (mostly USA and Japan), - development of R & D statistics to measure this factor of increased productivity and competitiveness. (b) Services Services statistics will continue to be developed by an approach which is both global and sectoral. Consolidating the methodology for the statistics of service enterprises and institutions will call for increased integration with the industrial enterprise and service enterprise (including statistics analysis of the growth of ancillary enterprise services). The methodological work will have to take into account the experience gained from pilot surveys which themselves will require support and coordination at Community level. The 'enterprise' approach must be supplemented by developing the methodology for functional statistics of services, particularly the statistics of products, functions, prices and volumes. Measuring the impact of the Single Market on several important and sometimes fragile sectors will require specific surveys in several priority fields. For example, financial services, services rendered to enterprises, communications and the audiovisual sector will be regarded as priority at Community level and work already commenced will be intensified so that information systems can be set up. At the same time, the new perspectives opened up by the Treaty on Political Union, and particularly the activities under 'Social Europe', point to the emergence of new service sectors for individuals and local authorities such as social security, education, health and welfare recreation, cultural and sporting activities, etc. These must be analysed under the 'services enterprises' approach, devoting particular attention to the treatment of non-market services and to the close links between these sectors and the functional analysis of public expenditure. The development of statistics on service enterprises must als be linked to an information system based on sectoral registers which cover the social economy and the craft industry, and with implementation of an 'Action programme for the development of a system of statistics on trade and distribution'. 4. Transport statistics The Maastricht Treaty puts the accent on moving forward in respect of transport by a market liberalization policy; in other words, as far as statistics are concerned, priority must be given to statistics which do not yet exist at Community level, i.e. statistics on air and sea transport. However, apart from the various modes of transport, statistics are needed on the use of infrastructures and means of transport. A high degree of priority must therefore be accorded to passenger transport. The framework already laid down for transport statistics will, of course, continue to be developed through the revision of directives on transport by road, rail and inland waterway and these will be extended to air and sea transport. The information system must be consolidated by a more intermodal approach which can link sectoral methodologies and simplify survey organization. 5. R & D statistics The competency for research and technological development vested in the Community by virtue of the Single Act, strenghtened by the Maastricht agreements and Community policy on promoting innovation, calls for up-to-date and precise statistics. Pursuant to the proposal for a Council Decision on R & D and innovation statistics, the aims of the 1993 to 1997 programme will be to consolidate the present situation and to extend data collection activities, i.e. new information on R & D workers, measuring the technological potential of the regions and pilot surveys on innovation. Cooperation with the OECD should be stepped up so as to obtain information on R & D financing and expenditure within shorter deadlines. 6. Energy statistics The outlook for energy statistics depends on developments in the economic situation in general and the energy market in particular. Efforts will be directed at improving balance sheets, as regards both product breakdowns and aggregates. The price and consumption surveys will need to be expanded so as to provide better coverage. The activities envisaged will improve, and render more comparable, statistics on the transparency of energy prices and flows, security of supply with targeted measures regarding the extension of the geographical distribution of resourced, the substitution of energy products, the rational use of energy, the exploitation of renewable energy sources, the impact on the environment of emissions resulting from the transformation of energy products (CO2, SO2 etc.) and assessment of their economic significance and on regional energy investment. A strategy of careful use of non-energy raw materials is an important counterpart to these activities. When the networks are opened up, statistical monitoring of their use may be necessary. 7. Tourism statistics A system of tourism statistics will need to be set up in the context of the European Economic Area, based mainly on tourist supply and demand. B. The sectoral programmes for management of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and fisheries statistics Purpose To contribute to the statistical information necessary to manage and monitor the arrangements made under the CAP and as part of fisheries policy. Statistical objectives To propose to the Member States the Community surveys to be carried out, the comparable processing of national surveys, the application of harmonized standards and the introduction of common infrastructure statistics in the following fields: 1. Agricultural statistics Agricultural statistics will undergo a significant change in the coming years as a result of the reform of the CAP and the implementation of the results of a 'screening' operation carried out under the previous programme. It seems inevitable that changes to the instruments for collecting information on production and forecasting production, prices, revenues and agricultural structures will be necessary. The goal is to attain better utilization of the resources devoted to agricultural statistics while limiting as far as possible the growing administrative burden on farmers. (a) Agricultural production Crop production: the introduction of stabilizers in various sectors of crop production, as well as certain likely elements in CAP reform, have emphasized the need to improve the quality, comparability and provision times of these statistics. Reform of the CAP will reinforce the direct impact of statistics on market management. It is therefore necessary not only to create a binding legal framework for crop statistics, but also to continue to seek the most appropriate means of guaranteeing their reliability and objectivity whilst containing financial and manpower costs as far as possible. It is with this aim in mind that research on sampling and forecasting techniques and remote sensing for agricultural statistics will be continued and, if possible, intensified. Animal production: Community statistics and legislation will have to adapt to changes in the markets and market management; they will therefore need to be reviewed carefully at regular intervals in order to ensure that the objectives can be attained at the lowest cost, taking account in particular of the different levels of importance of production in the various countries. Special attention will have to be paid to improving the overall information on slaughterings. Supply balances: these balances provide a synthesis of the statistics on the supply and uses of the various crop and animal products, and their main function is to permit monitoring of the degree of self-sufficiency and of consumption. Adaptations may be required as a consequense of the new system of intra-Community trade after 1992. It is necessary to improve their quality and better define the essential information required, taking account of the fact that the figures constitute reference data for international agreements, in particular for GATT. Fodder supply balances: statistics have been compiled for the last 20 years on the supply of animal feedingstuffs. Studies have been undertaken to determine the nutritional needs of animals in order to assess the demand for feedingstuffs well before data on supply are known. Efforts have been undertaken and will continue to be undertaken to compare the supply and demand side to improve knowledge of the feedingstuffs consumed by each category of animals. CAP reform, which will reinforce the role of the markets, will imply a special effort to obtain information on the levels of stocks of agricultural products, private and public, in view of their impact on the market. (b) Agricultural prices and incomes Verifying and improving the sources and methods used in the preparation of the Economic Accounts for Agriculture constitute an important task which will lead to greater harmonization of statistics between Member States and improved knowledge of the disparities in agricultural income that still exist in the Community. The quality and analysis of agricultural income forecasts will be further improved. The development of analysis of total income of agricultural households will lead to a greater understanding of total income in agriculture. Forecasting and simulation models (short- and medium-term), based on an integrated agricultural sector database, will be developed and/or maintained. These will constitute a tool for forecasts and simulation of the effects of alternative agricultural policies. The use of these models will allow policy-makers to support their proposals. Member States will be more closely associated with this work. (c) Agricultural structures During the years 1993 to 1997, the Member States will carry out all the surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings provided for in Regulation 571/88. In order to facilitate access to and utilization of the results from these surveys, it will be necessary to continue development of the new databank system (Eurofarm). The use of statistics from administrative sources (registers), especially for permanent crops, should provide the Commission with an indispensable set of data on trends in the agricultural sectors concerned. (d) Agri-food industry Bringing together data on the industries linked to agriculture will continue. Users needs will be met by drawin on existing data and taking advantage of improvements being prepared particularly in enterprise statistics. (e) Forestry Improved information on the forestry sector is needed in the light of the relevant Community policy. In this context it is necessary to reinforce the efforts to improve information on the structure of forestry units and to try to establish a Community forestry inventory. 2. Fisheries statistics The common fisheries policy covers several areas of interest that require the provision of statistics: market management, conservation of fish stocks and restructuring of the fishing industry. The Regulations already adopted on landings of fishery products and catches in the north-east and north-west Atlantic require the compilation of the most essential statistics. In the years to come, the quality of these data will have to be improved by a continuous exchange of information on the methods employed by the Member States. Preliminary work has already been undertaken to improve existing statistics on fishing in the Mediterranean, as well as on aquaculture. C. Sectoral programmes for environment policy Purpose To draw up a set of statistical indicators enabling Community programmes on the environment to be prepared, implemented, monitored and assessed. Statistical objectives To propose to the Member States the Community surveys to be carried out, the comparable processing to be done from existing data, the application of standards and the establishment of common statistical infrastructures in the following field: Environment statisticsThe period covered by the new programme coincides with the fifth Community action programme on the environment, entitled 'Towards sustainability', which is based on the principles of sustainability and shared responsibility of all the various operators and sectors. The programme recommends moving from a strategy based on normative legislation to the development of a set of economic and social instruments which will enable the aim of sustainability to be integrated into all fields and bring about a change in the behaviour of the various operators and introduce a concept of environmental liability. The idea of sustainability will be taken up at world level by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), which will meet in Brazil in June 1992 and has an agenda for the 21st century which includes a section on the development of an appropriate information policy. In this context, the aims of the environmental statistics programme for 1993 to 1997 should be to continue and extend the work begun in 1989 to 1992 and to implement the results of studies which are currently under way. Priority action concerns: - the introduction of a system for collecting statistics on waste in connection with Community legislation on waste management, - introduction of a system for collecting statistics in connection with industrial surveys on the generation of emissions and wast and the costs incurred for prevention and elimination; identification and description of the eco-industries, - collaboration in the establishment of a register of emissions and waste by economic sector in cooperation with the EEA (Corinair project), - harmonization of statistics on public spending on the environment and R & D efforts in this field, - producing indicators and analysing statistics on transport, raw materials and energy, industry agriculture and tourism in application of the environmental policy in these sectors, - involvement in international work on satellite accounts of the environment. In the next few years, statistics should progress thanks to the introduction of Community standards on environmental planning, accounting and auditing by enterprises and public administrations, increasing information for and the responsibility of consumers and individuals, by research into why and how human activities affect the environment, and by the development of an economic theory and empirical methods for putting a price on damage to the environment; this latter aspects is intended to show the cost of environmental deterioration and the depletion of natural resources as reflected in economic accounts. II. SECTORAL PROGRAMMES FOR SOCIAL POLICY, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COHESION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION Purpose To contribute to the preparation of harmonized statistical indicators on employment, unemployment, populat"

Information society technologies increasingly pervade all industrial and societal activities and are accelerating the globalisation of economies, in particular by providing SMEs with new ways to access the global marketplace, and societies.Europe's industrial competitiveness, its jobs, its quality of life and the sustainability of growth depend on it being at the leading edge of the development and take-up of information society technologies. Also, by enabling communities in remote and rural areas to overcome isolation and to compete in the global economy, information society technologies contribute to cohesion in the European Union.At the same time, the technologies underpinning the development of the information society are in rapid evolution. Advances in information processing and communications are opening up exciting new possibilities. There is a shift from stand-alone systems to networked information and processes. Digitalisation is resulting in the convergence of information processing, communications and media. Content is of increasing significance. However, the increasing diversity and complexity of systems is also presenting new challenges for their development and use.It will not be possible to realise the full potential of the information society in Europe with only today's technologies and applications. Key requirements such as usability, dependability, interoperability and, above all, affordability are far from being sufficiently met for the broad deployment of information society technologies (i.e. information and communication technologies, systems, applications and services) in all areas. Continuous efforts are required, in research, technological development, demonstration and technology take-up. These efforts must, in all activities, tackle the universal issues such as access, ease of use, cost-effectiveness and interoperability and standardisation. They should also address the socioeconomic impact of the activities, in particular the social changes brought about by the introduction and more widespread use of new information and communications technologies including their effect on different population groups, with particular attention to their effect on women and young people. Tackling the issues of access and ease of use in this context shall be an important priority.Strategic objectives of the programmeThe strategic objective of the information society technologies (IST) programme is to realise the benefits of the information society for Europe both by accelerating its emergence and by ensuring that the needs of individuals and enterprises are met.The programme has four interrelated specific objectives, which both focus the technology developments and enable the close articulation between research and policy needed for a coherent and inclusive information society. For the private individual the objective is to meet the needs and expectations of European citizens for high-quality, affordable general interest services. Addressing the requirements and concerns of Europe's enterprises, workers and consumers the objective is to enable both individuals and organisations to innovate and be more effective and efficient in their work and business, while at the same time improving the quality of the individual's working life. Multimedia content is central to the information society; the objective here is to confirm Europe as a leading force in this field and enable it to realise the potential of its creativity and culture. For the essential technologies and infrastructures that form the building blocks of the information society the objective is to drive their development, enhance their applicability and accelerate their take up in Europe.Novelty of the approach. Community-funded research in information and communication technologies and applications is integral to the overall strategy of the European Union for the information society, which was defined by the action plan 'Europe's way towards the information society` and revised in the action plan adopted in November 1996. The information society technologies (IST) programme introduces a new approach to the information society theme of the framework programme.Integration. The context, rationale and objectives of the IST programme necessitate a single and integrated programme which reflects the convergence of technologies and media and of industries and markets, together with the increasing significance of content, and responds to the need to integrate research and development and take-up actions. To this effect, this programme consists of a set of four key actions centred on the four specific objectives and a specific activity on longer-term or higher-risk research on future and emerging technologies. These activities complement each other and are derived by grouping together the technologies, systems, applications and services and the research and development and take-up actions with the greatest affinity or interdependence. Each activity has its own specific focus and priorities, however, the key issues of usability, interoperability, dependability and affordability will be addressed ubiquitously throughout the programme. In doing so, each key action will, as appropriate, have a balance of the complete range of RTD activities from basic research to demonstration and take-up actions.Cross-programme themes. The coordination and integration of the activities through a single work programme allows a 'theme` that cuts across the programme (e.g. interfaces, mobility or satellite-related activities) to be addressed in a coherent manner in more than one activity, each concentrating on and contributing from its particular perspective. Clustering and concertation will be used to focus, coordinate and integrate activities. Work, spanning the programme, will be undertaken on integrated application platforms to provide seamless interaction between citizens, businesses and administrations by realising coherent groups of public and private services customised to users' requirements, these will be demonstrated and assessed in 'digital sites`, encompassing cities or regions, paving the way to 'digital communities` in urban, rural, remote and ultraperipheral areas, and will be appropriately coordinated with other key actions, for example 'The city of tomorrow and cultural heritage`, and initiatives in the Structural Funds. It will build on activities from all parts of this programme.Flexibility. The technological scope of the activities provides the flexibility to refocus over time, through the single rolling work programme (defined in consultation with the key actors), to respond to changes in industrial and societal needs and the technological context.Socioeconomic needs. A vast range of goods, services and processes are being transformed through the integration and use of information society technologies. Work will target the quantitative and qualitative benefits that information society technologies offer in all industrial and societal activities, from more competitive methods of working and doing business to higher-quality, lower-cost general interest services or new forms of leisure and entertainment. It will take account of the info-ethical implications, of the necessity to remove discriminating factors, such as gender bias, to ensure ease of access and use, and of the ageing population and of the need to contribute to increasing resource efficiency and reducing environmental impact. Socioeconomic research, together with the results of other Community initiatives that identify needs for information society technologies, such as regional programmes, will be integrated throughout the programme, to support the take-up of information society technologies, and into its management. As too will be work on statistics, which are central to the information society and for which information society technologies offer new ways to attain the highest standards of quality and the widest and most rapid and accessible dissemination. Particular attention will be paid to ensuring that the 'innovation dimension` is actively addressed, and to stimulating and supporting the participation of SMEs, so as to contribute to the effective take-up of research results for economic and societal benefit.European added-value. Realising the full potential of the information society requires technologies, infrastructures, applications and services, accessible and usable by anyone, anywhere, any time, whether it be for business or individual use. Collaborative research and technological development is needed to create both the critical efforts and the interoperability necessary to ensure this in Europe. Pan-European research is also needed to ensure that content, together with its creation and use, properly reflects and exploits the EU's cultural diversity and many languages.European competitiveness. Information society technologies are integrated in or support products and processes in all sectors of the economy. To be competitive in the global marketplace Europe needs to master both the supply and use of information society technologies. To this end, to accelerate the realisation of knowledge as innovation, this programme integrates actions to stimulate the take-up of information society technologies with the research and technological development to ensure that the conditions and requirements for their use can be met. In addition to demonstrations and trials, these include actions to stimulate the development and diffusion of the skills necessary to take-up research and development results (such as validations, assessments, awareness building, first-user actions and best-practice initiatives) and consensus building and standardisation activities.LINKS AND COMPLEMENTARITY WITH THE OTHER PROGRAMMESArticulation with the other thematic programmes is based on concentrating the activities concerned with the development, demonstration and take-up of information society technologies in this programme and concentrating their deployment (domain-specific integration research as well as use) in specific domains in the other thematic programmes. The nature of information society technologies requires close coordination with other programmes and relevant policy initiatives in areas where their deployment plays a critical role. Particular attention will be paid to the programmes covering manufacturing, transport, the environment and healthcare. In the case of satellite-related activities, these will be coordinated with related activities in other programmes and initiatives in the context of the Commission's Space Coordination Group. In accordance with Article 6 of the European Parliament and Council Decision on the fifth framework programme, the utmost respect will be ensured for human rights and fundamental ethical principles in all the activities under the specific programme.Reflecting the global nature of the information society, international cooperation will play a major role in the development and take-up of information society technologies. This will be reflected in the participation in and operation of this programme, including support for international initiatives such as IMS (intelligent manufacturing systems), and in its linkages with the programme on confirming the international role of Community research addressing support for organisations from third countries.Specific activities to facilitate the participation of organisations from third countries and to maintain links with European-trained specialists in third countries will also be used in addressing the international dimension of the programme. Where appropriate, work will complement and be coordinated with that in the COST framework. Innovation activities integrated throughout the programme will provide a focus for the promotion of the deployment and use of results stemming from this programme and help ensure complementarity with and interface to innovation activities carried out within the programme 'Promotion of innovation and encouragement of SME participation`. In addition, links at the programme level with Eureka, trans-European network actions and other Community instruments will be used to promote appropriate routes and mechanisms for the further take-up and the deployment of results. Links with the programme on promotion of innovation and encouragement of SME participation will complement the actions to reinforce the effective participation of SMEs (such as exploratory awards) that are integrated in this programme.Improving the know-how, skills and qualifications of European researchers and the understanding of the socioeconomic impact of research in the fields covered by this programme is essential to ensure sufficient availability of appropriate expertise and to establish tangible and lasting impacts. Training and socioeconomic research will therefore form an integral part of this programme, complemented by appropriate links with the horizontal programme 'Improving the human research potential and the socioeconomic knowledge base` and European Social Fund initiatives. Training activities will include support to fellowships, which will take the form of 'Marie Curie` fellowships following the definitions and rules set out in the horizontal programme. This programme's work on research networking will interface with the horizontal programme's support for access to large computing facilities and with the 'support for research infrastructures` activities of the other thematic programmes.Full use will be made of the possibilities offered by COST and Eureka, and by cooperation with international organisations, to foster synergy between actions and projects in this programme and nationally funded research activities.

2003/813/EC: Commission Decision of 21 March 2000 declaring a concentration compatible with the common market and the EEA Agreement (Case No IV/M.1636 - MMS/DASA/Astrium) (notified under document number C(2000) 693) (Text with EEA relevance)
Official Journal L 314 , 28/11/2003 P. 0001 - 0025
Commission Decisionof 21 March 2000declaring a concentration compatible with the common market and the EEA Agreement(Case No IV/M.1636 - MMS/DASA/Astrium)(notified under document number C(2000) 693)(Only the English text is authentic)(Text with EEA relevance)(2003/813/EC)THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 57 thereof,Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 of 21 December 1989 on the control of concentrations between undertakings(1), as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1310/97(2), and in particular Article 8(2) thereof,Having regard to the Commission decision of 3 December 1999 to initiate proceedings in this case,Having regard to the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Concentrations(3),Whereas:(1) On 29 October 1999, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 (the Merger Regulation) by which Matra Marconi Space NV (MMS) and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG (DASA), via its subsidiary DASA Dornier Raumfahrt Holding GmbH (DDRH), acquire joint control of Astrium, a newly created company active in the space sector, to which all of MMS's and most of DASA's activities relative to space systems will be transferred.(2) By decision dated 3 December 1999, the Commission found that the notified operation raised serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market. The Commission accordingly initiated proceedings in this case pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) of the Merger Regulation.I. THE PARTIES AND THE OPERATION(3) MMS is jointly controlled by Matra Hautes Technologies SAS (MHT) and by Marconi Electronic Systems Limited (Marconi). The principal activities of MMS are the manufacture and supply of space systems, including satellites and their payloads, subsystems for launchers and manned space flight vehicles, ground stations and various subsystems and technologies.(4) MHT is part of Aérospatiale-Matra, a French company primarily engaged in commercial and military aerospace, guided weapons, information and telecommunications. In the space sector, and in addition to its stake in MMS, Aérospatiale-Matra owns, notably, controlling interests in companies active in launchers, space infrastructure and spacecraft equipment. Aérospatiale-Matra is controlled by the French State and Lagardère, a French group also active in the automotive and media sectors.(5) Marconi, formerly owned by the General Electric Company (GEC), has been merged with and into British Aerospace plc, now renamed BAe Systems plc (BAe Systems). BAe Systems is a group based in the United Kingdom, which primarily operates in commercial and military aircraft, guided weapons, marine engineering and naval architecture and defence electronics. In the space sector, and in addition to its stake in MMS, BAe Systems owns controlling interests in a number of companies active in spacecraft equipment.(6) DDRH is exclusively controlled by DASA, a German company which combines the activities of the Aviation and Space Systems Division of the DaimlerChrysler group. In the space sector, and in addition to the activities that will be contributed to Astrium, DASA owns, in particular, controlling interests in Eurockot Launch Services GmbH, which operates in the field of launch services. DASA belongs to the DaimlerChrysler group, which also operates in the automotive and service sectors.(7) Pursuant to a shareholders' agreement, Astrium will be a 50:50 joint venture of MMS and DDRH. Astrium will combine all of MMS's activities (supply of space systems and subsystems) and all the DASA activities currently performed in its subsidiary Dornier Satellitensysteme GmbH (supply of satellite systems and subsystems) and its division Raumfahrt-Infrastruktur (supply of space infrastructure and launchers). Astrium will be managed as one single multinational entity with cross-border business divisions, and it will mainly operate through three legal entities located in France, Germany and the United Kingdom.II. CONCENTRATION(8) Astrium will be jointly controlled by MMS and DASA (hereafter collectively designated as ""the parties""). A management board consisting of four members, two proposed by each of the parties, will be appointed by unanimous vote of the shareholders. All major decisions relating to the commercial policy and strategy of Astrium, such as the mid-term plan (equivalent to the business plan), the annual budget and the appointment and removal of legal representatives of the operational companies, require the unanimous approval of MMS and DASA. This confers joint control of Astrium to MMS and DASA, as the parties must reach an agreement on the major decisions concerning the strategic commercial behaviour of Astrium.(9) Astrium will furthermore perform on a lasting basis all the functions of an autonomous economic entity, as it will combine all of MMS's activities and most of DASA's space activities, and will therefore have access to the necessary assets, personnel, manufacturing facilities and commercial and service networks in order to conduct on a lasting basis its business activities.(10) In the light of the above, it is clear that the proposed transaction is a concentration within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation.III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION(11) The combined aggregate worldwide turnover of the parties to the concentration exceeded EUR 5000 million(4) in 1998 and each of the undertakings concerned had a Community-wide turnover of more than EUR 250 million. The undertakings concerned did not each achieve more than twothirds of their aggregate turnover within one and the same Member State. The notified operation therefore has a Community dimension within the meaning of Article 1(2) of the Merger Regulation. It does not constitute a cooperation case under the EEA Agreement.IV. COMPATIBILITY WITH THE COMMON MARKET(12) Astrium will be active in the manufacture and supply of space systems and their subsystems and equipment. As indicated in previous Commission decisions(5), space systems generally comprise two main segments: a space segment (satellite, orbital platform, launcher and so on), and a ground segment, which either commands and controls the space segment (orbit, mission parameters and so on) or provides an interface (such as transmission of voice and data signals) with the space segment. The space segment can be further categorised into satellites, space infrastructure and launchers.(13) The concentration does not raise competition concerns in the markets for civilian communication satellites, satellite ground segments and launch services.(14) Both parties are active in observation and scientific satellites, probes, space infrastructure and launcher equipment, and the Commission, in its decision of 3 December 1999 pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) of the Merger Regulation, had expressed serious doubts about these markets. In that decision, the Commission had also expressed serious doubts about the markets for systems and equipment products for launchers. However, there are, for the reasons indicated in sections A to C below, no competition concerns about these markets.(15) Finally, the parties are also active in certain satellite equipment products and military satellites, and there are strong indications that the operation would create or strengthen a dominant position in:- mechanical wheels for satellites in Europe(6) (Section A),- military communication satellites in France (Section C).A. SATELLITESRELEVANT PRODUCT MARKETSThe prime contracting level(16) Satellites are complex spacecraft orbiting or revolving around a celestial object. As was indicated in previous Commission decisions(7), four main categories can be distinguished: communications satellites, navigation satellites, observation (remote sensing) satellites and scientific satellites. Satellites can be utilised for civilian as well as military applications.(17) Broadly speaking, a standard satellite consists of two basic parts: the platform and the payload. The platform (or bus) is the physical structure of the satellite that ensures its stability and thermal control, while the payload governs the main parameters of the platform and is designed to perform the particular tasks for which the satellite was put in orbit.(18) The satellite sector is often categorised as a commercial segment, comprising those satellites (essentially communication satellites) sold to commercial operators, and an institutional segment (essentially consisting of observation and scientific satellites) essentially sold to space agencies such as NASA, the French Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) or the European Space Agency (ESA). Commercial operators usually source satellites based on proven designs, and procure these satellites through global competitive bidding procedures. Conversely, institutional customers often purchase specific (often tailor-made) satellites, and competition is usually restricted to domestic satellite prime contractors. More especially, in the case of ESA, procurement is subject to a geographic ""juste retour"" principle requiring a balance between the financial contribution of Member States to the ESA and the industrial share of business awarded to manufacturers of these Member States.(19) The parties submit that a distinction should be made between communication satellites and observation and scientific satellites, because they do not involve the same technological skills and do not address the same customers. This view has been widely endorsed by the results of the Commission enquiry, and is further confirmed by the fact that, for the reasons detailed above, the conditions of competition are different between the commercial and the institutional segments. It therefore appears that communication satellites, on the one hand, and observation and scientific satellites, on the other hand, belong to different product markets.(20) For the purpose of this case, it is not necessary to delineate the relevant product markets for navigation satellites, as this segment is still at an early development stage in Europe and because neither of the parties manufacture such satellites.(21) Commercial communication satellites include either Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO), medium earth orbit (MEO) or Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. According to the parties, an important development in the communication segment is the introduction of multimedia communication satellites, particularly LEO satellite constellations (such as Iridium and Globalstar) financed and operated by private consortia. In an earlier decision(8), the Commission drew a distinction between GEO and MEO/LEO satellites on the basis of cost, function and other factors. However, for the purpose of this case, it is not necessary to delineate further the relevant product markets for commercial communications satellites as in all alternative market definitions considered, effective competition would not be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of that area.(22) Institutional customers (primarily the space agencies) essentially procure observation and scientific satellites and space probes (scientific space vehicles for exploration of the solar system and beyond). These are usually tailor-made products designed to perform specific missions, including inter alia meteorology, cartography, astronomy, study of solar winds, etc.(23) The parties submit that observation and scientific satellites and space probes (hereafter collectively designated ""institutional satellites"") can be combined into a single product market. This view is supported by the fact that there appears to be substantial supply-side substitutability between these product categories, as European-based satellite prime contractors are usually active in all segments; and also by the fact that the conditions of competition within institutional markets are essentially similar, with all products being purchased by the same customers and through similar procurement processes. Conversely, there appears to emerge a specific commercial market for observation satellites, and, for the reasons indicated above, there appears to be no demand-side substitutability between the various product categories. However, for the purposes of this decision, it is not necessary to delineate further the relevant product markets for civil institutional satellites as, in all alternative market definitions considered, effective competition would not be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of that area.(24) Communication and observation satellites may be used for civil or military applications. It appears from the results of the Commission investigation that military satellites usually use the same platforms as civilian satellites, but require specific adaptations related to satellite integrity, data protection, and so on. There are also indications that the conditions of competition are different, between military and civil applications, since, in particular, governments may seek to restrict military expenditures to national suppliers. Consequently, the results of the Commission enquiry appear to be in favour of distinct product markets for military applications.The equipment level(25) As was indicated in recital 17, a standard satellite essentially consists of a platform and a payload. The platform is the physical structure of the satellite, and typically ensures its stability and thermal control, maintains its orbit, and supplies electrical energy. The payload governs the main parameters of the platform and is designed to perform the particular tasks for which the satellite was put in orbit. As a result, the same platform may be used for several applications, while the payload is usually specific to the mission to be carried out by the satellite.(26) Both the platform and the payload are in turn composed of a number of subsystems (such as propulsion units or attitude and orbit control systems for the platform, or the main instruments for the payload) and equipment (such as earth and star sensors, solar generators, and antennae). It appears from the results of the Commission enquiry that each of these products might constitute a distinct product market.(27) In particular, there would appear to be a distinct product market for mechanical wheels, which are used for the stabilisation of the satellite attitude. This is because, although other equipment products (namely propulsion systems and magnetic wheels) may be used for the same purpose, none of them would appear to be substitutable for mechanical wheels.(28) First, although propulsion systems can be used to control the satellite attitude, their use implies consuming the fuel stored in the satellite. Given that limited quantities of fuels are available in the satellite, and that mechanical and magnetic wheels rely instead on the electricity produced in sufficient quantities by the solar generators, propulsion systems are in practice only adapted to very short lifetime systems (less than one year) and are therefore rarely used. Propulsion systems are also based on very different technologies and know-how from mechanical and magnetic wheels, and usually are not produced by the same manufacturers.(29) Secondly, although magnetic and mechanical wheels function on the same basic principles, it appears that magnetic wheels have substantially higher performance and costs than mechanical wheels, and therefore are essentially used for those applications (for example, observation satellites) which require very accurate attitude control. Magnetic and mechanical wheels also rely upon different technologies and know-how, and, in Europe, are often not produced by the same manufacturers.(30) Overall, in the light of the results of the Commission investigation, there appears to be a distinct product market for mechanical wheels.RELEVANT GEOGRAPHIC MARKETSCommercial communication satellites(31) In previous Commission decisions(9), the markets for communication satellites and communication satellite equipment were considered to be global, as commercial customers purchase these products without being subjected to geographic considerations. The parties submit that the conditions of competition in the communication satellite sector are sufficiently homogeneous for the geographic market to be considered worldwide, as customers request quotations from, and place orders with, a variety of suppliers in Europe and the USA.(32) As was stated in the Aérospatiale/Matra(10) decision of 28 April 1999, satellites, space components and subsystems produced by USA-based companies are subject to an export licence arrangement managed by the Department of Defense in the USA. A recent change in the USA International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) has changed this export licence system, transferring the export of commercial communication satellites and equipment back to the jurisdiction of the Department of State from the Department of Commerce. It is necessary to examine whether this change can affect the conditions of competition for commercial satellites.(33) Some of the third parties which replied to the Commission enquiry expressed some concerns that this amounted to a tougher export licence system, which might cause delays in the supply of satellite components from the USA and might therefore make it more risky and difficult for non-US prime contractors to use such components. Others indicated that a tougher export licence system might also make it more difficult for European suppliers to offer certain components to US customers, because the specifications of the products to be procured by USA-based prime contractors might not easily be made available to non-US equipment suppliers.(34) However, on balance, it appears at this stage that such a change cannot be considered an effective barrier to trade between Europe and the USA (except for certain sensitive technologies), and most of the third parties which responded to the Commission enquiry indicated that they still considered the markets for communication satellites and components for communication satellites to be worldwide. It can therefore be concluded that the markets for communication satellites and components for communication satellites are worldwide.Civil institutional satellites(35) As was indicated in recital 22, observation and scientific satellites and space probes are primarily purchased by space agencies, and competition is usually restricted to domestic satellite prime contractors.(36) Especially, in the case of the ESA, procurement of satellites and equipment products is subject to a geographic ""juste retour"" principle enshrined in the ESA Convention requiring ESA (i) ""to grant preference to the fullest extent possible to industry in all [ESA] Member States"", and (ii) ""to ensure that all [ESA] Member States participate in an equitable manner, having regard to their financial contribution"". It follows that there appears to be a European market for observation and scientific satellites and space probes, as well as for the related equipment markets (including mechanical wheels).(37) There might also be national markets for observation and scientific satellites and space probes in those Member States where national space agencies apply similar procurement procedures at the prime contractor level. And there might also be a worldwide market for observation satellites sold to commercial operators or to institutional customers where a domestic producer does not exist (as in Asia), as these customers seem to obtain these systems through global competitive procurement. However, for the purposes of this decision, it is not necessary to delineate further these geographic markets nor those for the satellite equipment products, because, in the case of national or worldwide markets, effective competition would not be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of that area.Military satellites(38) Finally, the parties submit that the geographic markets for military satellites are at least EEA-wide, owing, in particular, to a development of European bilateral and multilateral programmes (such as the military reconnaissance satellite Helios 1, involving France, Italy and Spain). Similarly, it appears that certain Member States procure military satellites through open competitive processes involving prime contractors in Europe and the United States: for instance, in communication satellites, Hughes seems to have been engaged in all competitions for the Spanish Hispasat I satellites, while Lockheed Martin participates in the competition for the supply of the UK Skynet 5B satellite.(39) However, on the other hand, certain Member States would appear to continue sourcing military satellites from domestic producers. In particular, the French Ministry of Defence (MOD) indicated that it procured military satellites through open competition between MMS and Alcatel Space Industries (Alcatel Space). Given that the conditions of competition would be restricted to domestic prime contractors, there appears still to be a national geographic market in France for the supply of military satellites.(40) As far as the equipment for military satellites is concerned, it appears that there is no strict ""juste retour"" rule (except for some specific and critical products). In particular, military satellites usually use the same platform as civilian satellites, and platform products procured by the prime contractor may be purchased from the same suppliers as for civilian applications. Therefore, depending on the equipment concerned, the geographic markets for military satellite equipment would appear to be either national or worldwide. However, for the purposes of this decision, it is not necessary to delineate further these geographic markets because, in all alternative geographic market definitions considered, effective competition would not be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of that area.COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT FOR COMMERCIAL COMMUNICATION SATELLITES(41) There are no overlaps between the parties' (and their parent companies') activities in communication satellites, whether at the prime contractor level (where only MMS is active) or at the equipment level (where all of Aérospatiale-Matra, MMS and DASA are active, but each sells different equipment). However, the operation will result in a vertical integration between MMS's activities at the prime contractor level, and DASA's activities at the equipment level.(42) Some third-party suppliers have indicated that the vertical aspects of the operation could lead to a foreclosure of competing equipment suppliers or competing prime contractors. However, at the prime contractor level, MMS's average market shares (in value) between 1994 and 1998 do not exceed [10-15 %](11), and Astrium will remain subject to the competition from other large manufacturers, especially USA-based Hughes, Loral and Lockheed Martin; and, at the equipment level, DASA's average market shares during the 1995-1997 period do not exceed [20-30 %]* worldwide on any satellite equipment market.(43) In the light of the above, it appears that the notified operation does not create or strengthen a dominant position in communication satellites and equipment, as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of that area.COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT FOR INSTITUTIONAL SATELLITES(44) Both MMS and DASA are active as prime contractors for observation and scientific satellites and probes sold to national space agencies and ESA in Europe. Aérospatiale-Matra, MMS and DASA also produce certain equipment for those systems, including chemical thrusters (used in chemical propulsion systems), solar arrays (used in solar generators), mechanical wheels and earth and sun sensors.(45) The operation will therefore lead to a horizontal integration at the prime contractor level, and to a vertical integration between the prime contractor level and the parties' and Aérospatiale-Matra's activities at the equipment level.Market characteristics(46) Observation and scientific satellites and space probes are usually designed, developed, produced and launched in the context of phased projects, where competition takes place at certain steps. Institutional satellites are therefore bidding markets, and competition in these markets is determined by the presence of bidders with a capacity to offer credible alternatives to the parties' products.(47) Another important characteristic of these markets is that, as was indicated in recital 36, ESA procurement is subject to a geographic ""juste retour"" principle. Broadly speaking, this principle requires ESA (i) preferably to procure from companies in ESA Member States, and ii) to strike a balance between the financial contribution of Member States of ESA and the industrial share of business awarded to manufacturers of those Member States.(48) Some flexibility is allowed for each individual programme. For instance, in the case of scientific satellites and probes, the ""juste retour"" principle is applied on the basis of three-year periods: this means that each satellite or mission within this period need not be entirely geographically balanced, as long as a minimum return is achieved at the end of each three-year period. Similarly, in the case of observation satellites, although ""juste retour"" targets are set for each mission, the actual return contained in the industrial offers can deviate by up to 20 % from the initial targets.(49) However, overall, this flexibility is limited in so far as any imbalances will have to be offset and that, over a certain period of time, average national industrial shares will have to follow the ""juste retour"" contributions of the Member States concerned.Market players(50) It is generally recognised that only four companies in Europe can compete for the prime contracting of large or complex satellites: MMS, DASA, Alcatel Space Industries (Alcatel Space, a French company whose capital is shared between Alcatel, a telecommunication equipment group, and Thomson-CSF, a defence and professional electronics group), and Alenia Aerospazio (Alenia, an Italian company belonging to the Finmeccanica group). For smaller projects, other possible prime contractors include Kayser-Threde, OHB Systems, and SSTL. At worldwide level, there remain a number of major competitors, such as the USA-based companies TRW, Lockheed, and Ball Aerospace.Impact of the operation in possible national or worldwide markets(51) If there were national markets at prime-contractor and/or equipment level for observation and scientific satellites in those Member States where national space agencies procure institutional satellites on a national basis, the operation would create no overlaps, as DASA and MMS are not active in the same Member States. For the same reasons, vertical integration arising from the operation would not raise competition concerns either.(52) Similarly, if there were world markets for the supply of observation satellites to commercial operators or to institutional customers where a domestic producer does not exist, the parties' market shares (in terms of volumes ordered) would not exceed [25-35 %]*, and they would remain subject to the competition from other large satellite prime contractors including TRW [60-70 %]*.(53) In the light of the above, as far as national or worldwide markets for institutional satellites are concerned, it appears that the notified operation does not create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of that area.Impact of the operation at the prime-contractor level in Europe(54) Given the small number of observation and scientific satellites and probes launched each year in Europe, market shares calculated over a short period of time may not adequately reflect the actual market positions of the competing prime contractors. For this reason, average market shares (in terms of value) were calculated over the 1994 to 1998 period.(55) On that basis, Astrium will clearly be the leading prime contractor for institutional satellites. In terms of value, Astrium's members accounted for [45-55 %]* of sales of institutional satellites between 1994 and 1998 (MMS: [25-35 %]*, and DASA: [15-25 %]*), the next largest competitors being Alcatel Space [30-35 %]* and Alenia Aerospazio [5-10 %]*.Alenia will be an effective competitor, albeit for a limited number of projects(56) It appears from the Commission investigation that there is a limit to the number of ESA projects where Alenia can act as a prime contractor. This is because the average Italian contribution (12 %) to ESA institutional satellite programmes is much lower than the usual workshare (20-25 %) attributed to a prime contractor, and because the ""juste retour"" principle requires that the national industrial return be in line with the contribution to the relevant programme. Although actual returns (and thus Alenia's capacity to compete at the prime contractor level) may fluctuate from one mission to another and may deviate from the return targets, the overriding conclusion is that Alenia will have only limited capacity to compete at the prime-contractor level for ESA institutional satellite missions.(57) However, it also appears that Alenia will still be able to compete successfully for a number of European institutional satellites. This is because Alenia will still be able to perform both major tasks (such as payload or platform integration) for ESA institutional satellite programmes, and also to act as a prime contractor for Italian programmes (placed under the aegis of the Italian space agency). These activities appear to be sufficient for Alenia to maintain its competitiveness and to stay in the market, as is further indicated by the fact that Alenia was awarded the prime contracting of the ESA science satellite Integral (to be launched in 2001).Alcatel Space will be an effective competitor to Astrium for most projects(58) In the light of the above, competition will essentially be between Alcatel Space and Astrium, but Alenia will still be able to compete as a prime contractor for certain ESA programmes.(59) It also appears that Alcatel Space has the capacity to be an effective competitor to Astrium: first, Alcatel Space currently has the necessary core abilities to act as a prime contractor for every kind of satellite; and secondly, this capacity will not be restricted by the application of the ""juste retour"" principle, as the French contribution to ESA institutional satellites programmes (approximately 23 %) is close to the average workshare performed by a prime contractor.No possibility of raising rivals' costs through the ""juste retour"" rule(60) It has been argued that Astrium might be in a position to raise substantially its rivals' costs for ESA institutional programmes. This reasoning is based on the grounds (i) that in view of the ""juste retour"" principle, a certain proportion of each contract value will have to be carried out in Germany and the UK (together approximately 29 %); (ii) that Astrium's position in these Member States would be such as to make other prime contractors dependent on contributions from Astrium for these German and British returns; and (iii) that Astrium could raise its prices for these contributions, thereby either making its competitors' offers non-competitive or forcing its rivals' margins down to such an extent as to make these offers non-viable.(61) There is no indication that Astrium would be in a position effectively to raise Alenia's costs through this mechanism. This is so because, first, in those cases where Alenia would compete at the prime-contractor level, its share (and thus the Italian return) would match or even exceed the workshare allocated to a prime contractor (20-25 %). In those cases, therefore, the Italian contribution would exceed the average share of 12 % to be reached overall. Given that the parties are not active in Italy and would depend on Alenia for most of the Italian return, this implies that the parties would depend on a contribution"

COUNCIL DECISION (CFSP) 2021/2073
of 25 November 2021
in support of enhancing the operational effectiveness of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) through satellite imagery
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Articles 28(1) and 31(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,
Whereas:
(1)
On 12 December 2003 the European Council adopted the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (‘the EU Strategy’), Chapter III of which contains a list of measures to combat such proliferation.
(2)
The EU Strategy underlines the crucial role of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (CWC) and of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in creating a world free of chemical weapons. The objectives of the EU Strategy are complementary to those pursued by the OPCW in the context of its responsibility for the implementation of the CWC.
(3)

ANNEX
PROJECT DOCUMENT
Union Support for Enhancing the OPCW Operational Effectiveness through Satellite Imagery
1. Background
The OPCW analytical processes require corroboration and verification of evidentiary information provided in the most robust manners available. Satellite imagery, while not the only source of evidentiary information, can provide indicators and corroboration not available from other sources thus providing valuable analytical insights that can be used to ensure the full implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Key to this is sufficient capacity institutionally, of which imagery and imagery analysis can facilitate more detailed and robust mission planning, mitigation of security risks for deployed teams, as well as evidentiary information and analysis for more cost effective verification.
Through the implementation of Council Decision CFSP/2017/2303, the OPCW has come to rely on the unique information SATCEN’s imagery analysis provides both for mission planning and information analysis. OPCW efforts to conduct more thorough witness interviews, corroborate witness statements and more accurately identify locations of interest have been enhanced by satellite imagery. Since 2014, satellite imagery of the Syrian Arab Republic (SAR) has reinforced situational awareness and security and reduced risk for OPCW field missions with regard to locations to be visited/inspected. Integrating imagery analysis into operational planning has allowed OPCW teams to fine-tune their actions on site by providing team members with near real-time images of the area in which they will deploy. Imagery analysis has proven to be and will continue to be strategic enabler of OPCW’s analytical efforts.
Furthermore, a number of investigations of allegations of use remain outstanding as well as Executive Council (EC) Decisions mandating additional site visits, fact-finding missions and investigations that continue to require satellite imagery support. The unique analytical capabilities provided by SATCEN has allowed OPCW’s mandated teams to corroborate information from other sources and to analyse more thoroughly incidents of alleged use in SAR. Satellite imagery analysis has proven to be indispensable to the OPCW teams involved in SAR. Beyond its mandated activities related to SAR, the OPCW foresees an increasing role for satellite imagery analysis in cases of allegations of chemical weapons use outside of SAR to facilitate the implementation of CWC Article IX related activities (consultations, cooperation and fact-finding), as well as in the case of possible future accession to the CWC for possessor states.
2. Project Purpose
2.1 Overall Objectives of the Project
The overall objective of the Project is to ensure Secretariat capacity to facilitate implementation of CWC Article IX (consultations, cooperation and fact-finding) and related OPCW EC Decisions, through the provision of imagery services that addresses gaps in situational awareness for missions, such that it contributes to OPCW’s decreased deployment vulnerability and maximises OPCW’s analytical efficiency.
2.2 Specific Objectives
—
Expanding OPCW’s capacity to support OPCW mandated activities (DAT, FFM, IIT, etc.) through imagery analysis as a source of evidentiary substantiation or corroboration of findings.
—
Utilisation of targeted imagery analysis for areas of interest (sites, routes, etc.) in planning for OPCW mandated Missions (incidents of alleged use (IAU), challenge inspections (CI), technical assistance visit (TAV), etc.) to increase security and confidence in verification accuracy.
2.3 Results
Expected results the Project contributes to are as follows:
—
utilisation of imagery and analysis, regarding targeted evidence, to inform and corroborate teams findings and verification processes,
—
minimisation of security risks and increased situational awareness to facilitate the most efficient OPCW Mission planning possible.
3. Description of Activities
Activity 1 – Enabling the OPCW to effectively conduct, through imagery capacity, appropriate oversight and provide requisite reporting to OPCW policy making organs (EC and CSP)
This activity seeks to provide, through imagery and imagery analysis, the OPCW with the capacity to inform targeted analytical evidentiary undertakings, while optimising OPCW planning (allocation and efforts) for increased missions efficiency and decreased vulnerability.
Activity 2 – Enabling the OPCW through imagery capacity to accurately, effectively, and safely conduct verification activities and provide requested assistance to States Parties
This activity focuses on the provision of imagery services, on an as needed basis, for varied CWC fact finding requests submitted by States Parties (IAU, CI, TAV, etc.), as well as optimising OPCW planning (allocation and efforts) for increased missions efficiency and decreased vulnerability.
4. Duration
The total estimated duration of implementation funded through this project are expected to be incurred and concluded over a 48 month period.
5. Beneficiaries
Beneficiaries from the project will be OPCW Technical Secretariat personnel and teams; and CWC stakeholders including States Parties.
6. EU Visibility
The OPCW shall take all appropriate measures, within reasonable security considerations and visibility/communication measures available to the project, to publicise the fact that this project has been funded by the Union.

Recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2002 concerning the implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe
Official Journal L 148 , 06/06/2002 P. 0024 - 0027
Recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Councilof 30 May 2002concerning the implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe(2002/413/EC)THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(1),Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(2),Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),Whereas:(1) The coastal zone is of great environmental, economic, social, cultural and recreational importance to Europe.(2) Coastal zones possess a unique biodiversity in terms of flora and fauna.(3) Chapter 17 of Agenda 21, adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development summit in Rio in June 1992, should be taken into account.(4) The 1999 assessment report of the European Environment Agency indicates a continuing degradation of conditions in the coastal zones of Europe as regards both the coasts themselves and the quality of coastal water.(5) Community coastal zones are further threatened by the effects of climate change, in particular rising sea levels, changes in storm frequency and strength, and increased coastal erosion and flooding.(6) Population growth and the development of economic activities are increasingly threatening for both the environmental and social equilibria of coastal zones.(7) The decline of fishing activity and related employment makes many fisheries-dependent areas particularly vulnerable.(8) Existing regional disparities in the Community affect the management and conservation of each coastal zone in a different way.(9) It is essential to implement an environmentally sustainable, economically equitable, socially responsible, and culturally sensitive management of coastal zones, which maintains the integrity of this important resource while considering local traditional activities and customs that do not present a threat to sensitive natural areas and to the maintenance status of the wild species of the coastal fauna and flora.(10) The Community promotes integrated management on a larger scale by means of horizontal instruments. These activities therefore contribute to integrated coastal zone management.(11) The Commission notes in its Communications(4) to the Council and the European Parliament that integrated management of the coastal zone requires strategic, coordinated and concerted action at the local and regional level, guided and supported by an appropriate framework at the national level.(12) The Commission's demonstration programme on integrated coastal zone management identifies principles of good coastal zone management.(13) There is a need to ensure coherent action a at European level, including cooperative action and consultation with regional seas organisations or international organisations, such as the International Maritime Organisation, to address cross-border coastal zone problems.(14) Council Resolution of 6 May 1994 on a Community strategy for integrated coastal zone management(5) and Council Resolution of 25 February 1992 on the future Community policy concerning the European coastal zone(6) both identify the need for concerted European action to implement integrated coastal zone management.(15) Since the Resolution of 6 May 1994 the European Union has experienced an increase in pressure on coastal resources, an increase in coastal population and an increase in near-shore and on-shore infrastructure.(16) An integrated coastal zone management involves multiple factors among which town and country planning and land use are only accessorily concerned.(17) In accordance with the subsidiarity and proportionality principles as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty, and with Protocol 7 to the Treaty of Amsterdam on the implementation of subsidiarity and proportionality, and given the diversity of conditions in the coastal zones and the legal and institutional frameworks in the Member States, the objectives of the proposed action can best be achieved by guidance at the Community level,HEREBY RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING:CHAPTER IA strategic approachMember States take into account the sustainable development strategy and the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the sixth Community environment action programme(7), and take a strategic approach to the management of their coastal zones, based on:(a) protection of the coastal environment, based on an ecosystem approach preserving its integrity and functioning, and sustainable management of the natural resources of both the marine and terrestrial components of the coastal zone;(b) recognition of the threat to coastal zones posed by climate change and of the dangers entailed by the rise in sea level and the increasing frequency and violence of storms;(c) appropriate and ecologically responsible coastal protection measures, including protection of coastal settlements and their cultural heritage;(d) sustainable economic opportunities and employment options;(e) a functioning social and cultural system in local communities;(f) adequate accessible land for the public, both for recreational purposes and aesthetic reasons;(g) in the case of remote coastal communities, maintenance or promotion of their cohesion;(h) improved coordination of the actions taken by all the authorities concerned both at sea and on land, in managing the sea-land interaction.CHAPTER IIPrinciplesIn formulating national strategies and measures based on these strategies, Member States should follow the principles of integrated coastal zone management to ensure good coastal zone management, taking into account the good practices identified, inter alia, in the Commission's demonstration programme on integrated coastal zone management. In particular, coastal zone management should be based on:(a) a broad overall perspective (thematic and geographic) which will take into account the interdependence and disparity of natural systems and human activities with an impact on coastal areas;(b) a long-term perspective which will take into account the precautionary principle and the needs of present and future generations;(c) adaptive management during a gradual process which will facilitate adjustment as problems and knowledge develop. This implies the need for a sound scientific basis concerning the evolution of the coastal zone;(d) local specificity and the great diversity of European coastal zones, which will make it possible to respond to their practical needs with specific solutions and flexible measures;(e) working with natural processes and respecting the carrying capacity of ecosystems, which will make human activities more environmentally friendly, socially responsible and economically sound in the long run;(f) involving all the parties concerned (economic and social partners, the organisations representing coastal zone residents, non-governmental organisations and the business sector) in the management process, for example by means of agreements and based on shared responsibility;(g) support and involvement of relevant administrative bodies at national, regional and local level between which appropriate links should be established or maintained with the aim of improved coordination of the various existing policies. Partnership with and between regional and local authorities should apply when appropriate;(h) use of a combination of instruments designed to facilitate coherence between sectoral policy objectives and coherence between planning and management.CHAPTER IIINational stocktakingMember States conduct or update an overall stocktaking to analyse which major actors, laws and institutions influence the management of their coastal zone. This stocktaking should:(a) consider (but not be limited to) the following sectors and areas: fisheries and aquaculture, transport, energy, resource management, species and habitat protection, cultural heritage, employment, regional development in both rural and urban areas, tourism and recreation, industry and mining, waste management, agriculture and education;(b) cover all administrative levels;(c) analyse the interests, role and concerns of citizens, non-governmental organisations, and the business sector;(d) identify relevant inter-regional organisations and cooperation structures, and(e) take stock of the applicable policy and legislative measures.CHAPTER IVNational strategies1. Based on the result of the stocktaking, each Member State concerned, in partnership with the regional authorities and inter-regional organisations, as appropriate, should develop a national strategy or, where appropriate, several strategies, to implement the principles for integrated management of the coastal zone.2. These strategies might be specific to the coastal zone, or might be part of a geographically broader strategy or programme for promoting integrated management of a larger area.3. These strategies should:(a) identify the roles of the different administrative actors within the country or region whose competence includes activities or resources related to the coastal zone, as well as mechanisms for their coordination. This identification of roles should allow an adequate control, and an appropriate strategy and consistency of actions;(b) identify the appropriate mix of instruments for implementation of the principles outlined in Chapter II, within the national, regional or local legal and administrative context. In developing these strategies, the Member States should consider the appropriateness of:(i) developing national strategic plans for the coast to promote integrated management ensuring, inter alia, the control of additional urbanisation and of the exploitation of non-urban areas while respecting natural features of the coastal environment;(ii) land purchase mechanisms and declarations of public domain to ensure public access for recreational purposes without prejudice to the protection of sensitive areas;(iii) developing contractual or voluntary agreements with coastal zone users, including environmental agreements with industry;(iv) harnessing economic and fiscal incentives, and(v) working through regional development mechanisms;(c) develop or maintain national and, where appropriate, regional or local legislation or policies and programmes which address both the marine and terrestrial areas of coastal zones together;(d) particularly, identify measures to promote bottom-up initiatives and public participation in integrated management of the coastal zone and its resources;(e) identify sources of durable financing for integrated coastal zone management initiatives where needed, and examine how to make the best use of existing financing mechanisms both at Community and at national level;(f) identify mechanisms to ensure full and coordinated implementation and application of Community legislation and policies that have an impact on coastal areas, including when reviewing Community policies;(g) include adequate systems for monitoring and disseminating information to the public about their coastal zone. These systems should collect and provide information in appropriate and compatible formats to decision makers at national, regional and local levels to facilitate integrated management. The work of the European Environment Agency can serve inter alia as a basis for this purpose. These data should be publicly available in accordance with relevant Community legislation, in particular with the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on public access to environmental information and repealing Council Directive 90/313/EEC(8);(h) determine how appropriate national training and education programmes can support implementation of integrated management principles in the coastal zone.CHAPTER VCooperation1. Member States should encourage, enter into or maintain dialogue and implement existing conventions with neighbouring countries, including non-Member States in the same regional sea, to establish mechanisms for better coordination of responses to cross-border issues.2. Member States also work actively with the Community institutions and other coastal stakeholders to facilitate progress towards a common approach to integrated coastal zone management, examining the need for a European coastal stakeholders forum. In this process, ways of using existing institutions and conventions should be explored.3. In this context, cooperation with the accession countries is maintained and enhanced.CHAPTER VIReporting and review1. Member States report to the Commission on the experience in implementation of this Recommendation 45 months after its adoption.2. These reports are available to the public and include, in particular, information concerning:(a) the results of the national stocktaking exercise;(b) the strategy or strategies proposed at the national level for implementation of integrated coastal zone management;(c) a summary of actions taken, or to be taken, to implement the national strategy or strategies;(d) an evaluation of the expected impact of the strategy or strategies on the status of the coastal zone;(e) an evaluation of the implementation and application of Community legislation and policies that have an impact on coastal areas.3. The Commission should review this Recommendation within 55 months following the date of its adoption and submit to the European Parliament and the Council an evaluation report accompanied if appropriate by a proposal for further Community action.Done at Brussels, 30 May 2002.For the European ParliamentThe PresidentP.

These improvements have, however, been accompanied by challenges such as higher healthcare costs, an ageing population, and environmental degradation and heightened ethical concerns. Increasingly, a gap is becoming evident between natural resources, whether from agriculture and fisheries, mining or the global environment, and human activities. Paradoxically, this has occurred at a time when there is an explosion in the knowledge base concerning the structure and working of all living things, pointing towards new developments in the corresponding sectors, for example healthcare, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, food, etc.Europe has a strong tradition and an excellent record in research and application of life sciences and technologies. Furthermore, Europe provides a huge single market with a tradition of receptiveness for bio-based products. It has, therefore, the potential to address and solve major challenges such as a varied and safe food supply, affordable healthcare, better medicines, etc. The scientific basis on which living and natural materials are exploited for these ends is undergoing a dramatic change, in which the intimate and interactive workings of living beings are being revealed. With the progress of scientific knowledge in recent decades, one can now expect to probe more deeply the questions surrounding the production of food, the curing of diseases, and the sustainable management and use of biological resources. One can also anticipate clarifying their relationships with human behaviour and needs, industrial practices and consumer demands.The strategic objective of the programme is to link the ability to discover to the ability to produce, in order to address the needs of society and to meet the requirements of the consumer, leading to future wealth and job creation and improvements in the state of the environment. The strategy of this programme is to focus on specific areas where growing knowledge potentially contains technical answers to some of the pressing questions asked by the citizen which require to be tackled on a European scale. Fundamental ethical values must also be respected.The novelty of this approach is the willingness to couple the dynamics of massive knowledge production with few areas where there are expected to be desirable spin-offs, while pursuing the renewal of knowledge to reinforce European strengths in fields associated with further growth and quality of life.The proposed scientific and technological solutions should be seen as part of an integrated system approach, in which human beings are at the core of the issue of the quality of life and of the management of living resources. Six key actions have been identified in which European research should make a contribution, by way of innovative products, processes or services, to problem resolution. These key actions are targeted at socioeconomic needs and the Community's policy objectives, for example in agriculture and fisheries, industry and consumers, and in the fields of health and environment. The gender dimension will be integrated throughout the programme where appropriate.They are supplemented with research and technological development activities of a generic nature as well as support to research infrastructures aiming at building up, in the longer term, the knowledge base in areas of strategic importance for the future.Meeting socioeconomic needs. On the demand side, research should be developed which promotes health, reconciles economic developments with environmental requirements, and improves the response to consumer needs. The exploitation of the results of the programme must take account of the socioeconomic dimension. On the supply side, there is huge potential for economic growth and job creation in this field, both in the traditional industries including primary production and in the nascent high technology industries.Increasing European added-value. The major cross-border issues should be addressed selectively, such as health aspects of diseases (epidemiology, nutrition, food safety, ageing, including age-related disabilities and rare diseases), or transboundary resources management (terrestrial and aquatic living resources). Other areas such as drug abuse, biosafety or bioethics, involve the reinforcement of scientific bases in support of Community policies. Many of the activities to be addressed in the programme (e.g. genome research, neurosciences and technology assessment), due to their size and complexity, are only feasible if they are addressed at the European level.Improving European competitiveness. The programme will capitalise on specific scientific strengths in knowledge areas and in productive sectors with strong growth potential, such as the biotechnology and food industries. Thus, the heart of this programme, improving the quality of life, promoting life sciences and technologies and decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation, will contribute in the short and in the longer term to European competitiveness and employment. Europe must promote start-ups in particular in the areas of biotechnology and the agro-food industry which have recently shown a consistent growth rate.Promoting biosafety. The assessment of the behaviour and impact on human and animal health of recombinant organisms (e.g. transgenic plants, microorganisms, vaccines, etc.) and of their fate in the environment, where relevant, is part of every key action.Respecting an ethical framework. Full respect of human rights and fundamental ethical principles will be ensured throughout all activities in the specific programme in accordance with Article 6 of the European Parliament and Council Decision on the fifth framework programme. These principles include animal welfare requirements in conformity with Community law.LINKS AND COMPLEMENTARITY WITH THE OTHER PROGRAMMESCoordination with other thematic programmes is based on promoting synergetic interactions and complementary activities and avoiding unnecessary duplication:- coordination with the specific programme on a user-friendly information society is based on the following principle: activities concerned with information society technologies as such (which include development, demonstration and take-up actions) will be concentrated in the user-friendly information society programme; activities concerned with the deployment, integration and adaptation of information society technologies in applications relating to the quality of life and the management of living resources will be conducted in this programme,- coordination with the programmes on competitive and sustainable growth and energy, environment and sustainable development is based on close interaction between the key action 'Food, nutrition and health` of this programme and the key action 'Innovative products, processes and organisation` of the programme on competitive and sustainable growth and the corresponding aspects of the programme on energy, environment and sustainable development. Similar interactions will be established between the key actions 'The cell factory` and 'Sustainable agriculture, fisheries and forestry and integrated development of rural areas, including mountain areas` with the relevant actions of the programmes on competitive and sustainable growth and energy, environment and sustainable development,- close coordination will be developed with the programme 'Confirming the international role of Community research`, in particular where collaboration with international initiatives could bring added-value to European RTD efforts,- full use will be made of the possibilities offered by COST and Eureka and by cooperation with international organisations to foster synergy between actions and projects in this programme and nationally funded research activities. In the case of cooperation with Eureka, projects corresponding to themes of common interest with the framework programme may be developed in the context of the key actions in conformity with the selection criteria and procedures of the framework programme,- specific activities aimed at facilitating the involvement of entities in third countries and maintaining links with specialists from third countries trained in Europe will be carried out, which will also contribute to the international dimension of the programme,- concerning innovation and the participation of SMEs, as new knowledge in the biosciences constantly drives innovation, research partnerships need to be flexible and inclusive. A competitive partnership requires a high level of interaction of biology, engineering, information management, standardisation, capital investment, intellectual property rights, etc., which brings success only on a single-project basis. It will be imperative that measures to stimulate e.g. SMEs and financial partners accompany programme management for each individual action. An 'innovation unit` will focus the promotion activities with a view to the deployment and use of the results of this programme; it will also help to ensure complementarity and an interface with the innovation activities implemented in the context of the programme on 'Innovation and participation of SMEs`,- improving the know-how, skills and qualifications of European researchers and the understanding of the socioeconomic impact of research in the fields covered by this programme is essential to ensure sufficient availability of appropriate expertise and to establish tangible and lasting impacts. Training and socioeconomic research will therefore form an integral part of this programme, complemented by appropriate links with the horizontal programme 'Improving the human research potential and the socioeconomic knowledge base`. Training activities in this programme will include support to fellowships, which will take the form of 'Marie Curie` fellowships following the definitions and rules set out in the horizontal programme.(a) KEY ACTIONS(i) Food, nutrition and healthObjectives and RTD prioritiesThe aim of this key action is to promote the development of knowledge, technologies and methods, including prenormative aspects, based on multidisciplinary approaches to produce a safe, healthy, balanced and varied food supply for consumers covering the whole food chain thereby promoting consumer protection and contributing to the fight against diseases related to food and the immense costs to health systems arising therefrom. The following scientific and technological objectives will be pursued:- development of safe and flexible and new and/or improved manufacturing processes and technologies.The aim is to improve the quality and consumer acceptability of food, while ensuring traceability of raw materials and final products.RTD priorities: improved use of raw materials, production and processing and preservation systems; development of food crops and of functional and safe foods; use of fishery and aquaculture by-products and of poorly exploited species: quality and traceability of raw materials and food products in the food chain; minimal processing and process control; advanced food technologies and packaging systems; improvement of traditional technologies; quality monitoring and quality assurance, including the development of methods for measuring quality,- development of tests to detect and processes to eliminate infectious and toxic agents throughout the food chain.Research will focus on the hazards of food contaminants, their exact origins and strategies for safer food production.RTD priorities: improved understanding and control of contamination conditions; rapid detection tests for pathogens, xenobiotics and hormones; new and safer methods of food production; new methodologies for accessing microbial, chemical and allergenic risks,- research into the role of food in promoting and sustaining health with respect to diet and nutrition, toxicology, epidemiology, environmental interaction, consumer choice and public health.The aim is to reduce diet-related risk factors contributing to chronic disease and to develop new approaches for improved nutrition and more balanced diets.RTD priorities: the role and impact of food and diet on physiological functions, and physical and mental performance; the particular nutritional needs of defined population groups; links between diet and chronic disease and disorders including genetic factors involved; consumer attitudes and reactions with regard to food products, food-processing methods and labelling.(ii) Control of infectious diseasesObjectives and RTD prioritiesThe overall goal of this key action is to combat established, emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases including zoonoses, linked to old, new or mutated agents in humans or animals. This would be achieved primarily by mixing complementary expertise in transdisciplinary projects, by linking these activities to national and international organisations, and by encouraging the interface between academic research, policy-makers, healthcare providers, including the interface between preclinical and clinical research, and the human and animal healthcare industry, pursuing the following scientific and technological objectives:- the development of improved or novel mono-component, multi-component and combined vaccines, especially against viral diseases, including the support of multicentre clinical trials.RTD priorities: vaccines against emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and other diseases related to infectious agents (e.g. some cancers) consistent with the relevant Community policy regarding the reduction and eventual replacement of animal testing; vaccines against animal pathogens; development of European networks for clinical and field trials of vaccines and drugs including, where necessary, better understanding of the immune system,- new and improved strategies to identify and control infectious diseases, directed at treatment and prevention and based on studies on pathogenesis, emergence of resistance and immunological control.RTD priorities: improved understanding of mechanisms of protection against infectious agents, of drug resistance and control of immunological responses; technologies for safer and more efficient vaccines and immunotherapy; specific risk factors, including human behaviour and new technologies such as xenotransplants influencing the spread of infectious diseases and development of new and resistant strains; development and validation of diagnostic tests; research to support the development of and early-warning system and response network for infectious diseases; improved methodologies for early and accurate detection of adverse reactions to drugs and vaccines,- aspects connected with public-health, healthcare and care-delivery systems, notably management, prevention and surveillance, behavioural aspects and response to infectious diseases (including modelling of human diseases).RTD priorities: organisational and economic aspects of public health and healthcare systems; surveillance, monitoring and assessment methodologies in prevention and cure; methodologies for product safety surveillance in the market place.(iii) The cell factoryObjectives and RTD prioritiesThis key action is aimed at helping the Community's enterprises, either established or starting up, to exploit the advances made in life sciences and technology, particularly in the fields of health, environment, agriculture, agro-industries and high value-added products such as chemicals. It is aimed at the development of multidisciplinary technologies based on the exploitation of the properties of microorganisms, plants and animals, in particular at the tissue, cellular and sub-cellular levels. The objective is to understand the versatile functioning of cells and to develop bio-reactors, bio-molecules and bio-processes with high added-value capable of enhancing the quality of life and health. Being a prerequisite to the functioning of cells as minute factories, sufficient knowledge will have to be secured of their blueprint at the scale at which they operate, through underpinning contributions of structural biology, physiology, nanobiotechnology, genomics and proteomics, with the support of notably physicochemistry, bioinformatics and biochemical engineering. To ensure the safety of new biomolecules or bioprocesses, methods will be made available for monitoring their potential impact on human and animal health, and their contribution to improving standards of environmental care.This key action should also aim at using RTD to reinforce the prenormative research by making cell cultures available as models for medicine, pharmacology, toxicology and environmental monitoring as a substitute for animal testing. Emphasis would be put on the following scientific and technological objectives:- new and innovative health-related processes and products particularly from molecular engineering (for example diagnostics, antibiotics, anti-cancer agents, including plant produced therapeutics)Research will focus on bio-products relevant to preventing, detecting and treating human and animal diseases and improving the quality of life.RTD priorities: improved understanding of the cell, gene functions and gene-delivery methods applicable to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic substances and strategies; anti-cancer agents, antibiotics, antibodies and therapeutics, vaccines, novel in-vitro testing and screening methods as alternatives to animal testing; cells as production units and as diagnostic and detection tools,- energy-efficient bio-remediation and waste bio-treatment processesThe objective is to prevent, detect, monitor, treat and remove pollution as well as to maximise the economic value of waste.RTD priorities: new bio-processes for preventing industrial pollution, treating, upgrading, and/or recycling bioaccumulable wastes and industrial by-products; bioassays and biosensors; biodegradation of recalcitrant chemicals by microbial catalysts alone or in combination with plant systems and/or chemical catalysts; biodiversity and ecological dynamics of natural and introduced populations,- new biological and biotechnological processes and products, new processing technologies using microorganisms, plants or animals for agrifood and agroindustry and high value-added chemical applicationsThe focus is on high value biomolecules and bioprocesses leading to enhanced exploitation of renewable resources and to enhanced expression of desirable characteristics for microorganisms, plants and animals. These activities are targeted at sustainable and industrial exploitation prospects and take into account socioeconomic, agronomic, ecological and/or consumer perspectives.RTD priorities: exploiting the cellular and sub-cellular characteristics of improved microorganisms, plants and animals, including through approaches at genome level; development of methods and strategies for identifying recombinant organisms and their residues in the environment and assessing their potential impact on human and animal health or the environment; new biocatalysts; use of terrestrial and marine organisms as a source of new valuable products; identification and sustainable use of metabolic and genetic diversity.(iv) Environment and healthObjectives and RTD prioritiesThe aim of this key action is to achieve a better understanding of the interactions between the genetic, physiological, environmental and social factors involved in sustaining good health and so to help reduce the adverse impact on health of changes in the environment and the workplace and the immense costs to health systems arising therefrom. It covers in particular issues such as prevention and the effects on health of air pollution, heavy metals and toxic substances, noise, climatic changes and electromagnetic radiation, as well as the effects of pollution at the workplace. The following scientific and technological objectives will be pursued:- research into diseases and allergies related to or influenced by the"

COUNCIL JOINT ACTION 2008/588/CFSP
of 15 July 2008
on support for activities of the Preparatory Commission of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) in order to strengthen its monitoring and verification capabilities and in the framework of the implementation of the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 14 thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
On 12 December 2003, the European Council adopted the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Chapter III of which contains a list of measures that need to be taken both within the European Union and in third countries to combat such proliferation.
(2)
The EU is actively implementing this Strategy and is giving effect to the measures listed in Chapter III thereof, in particular through releasing financial resources to support specific projects conducted by multilateral institutions, such as the Provisional Technical Secretariat of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO).
(3)
On 17 November 2003, the Council adopted Common Position 2003/805/CFSP (1) on the universalisation and reinforcement of multilateral agreements in the field of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means of delivery. That Common Position calls, inter alia, for the promotion of the signature and ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).
(4)
The States Signatories to the CTBT have decided to establish a Preparatory Commission, endowed with legal capacity, for the purpose of carrying out the effective implementation of the CTBT, pending the establishment of the CTBTO.
(5)
The early entry into force and universalisation of the CTBT and the strengthening of the monitoring and verification system of the Preparatory Commission of the CTBTO are important objectives of the EU Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction. In this connection, the nuclear test carried out by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in October 2006 further underlined the importance of the early entry-into-force of the CTBT and the need for an accelerated building-up and strengthening of the CTBTO monitoring and verification system.
(6)
The Preparatory Commission of the CTBTO is engaged in identifying how its verification system could best be strengthened, including through the development of noble gas monitoring capacity and efforts aimed at fully involving States Signatories in the implementation of the verification regime. The Preparatory Commission should therefore be entrusted with the technical implementation of this Joint Action.
(7)
In the light of the above, the Council adopted Joint Action 2006/243/CFSP (2) and thereafter Joint Action 2007/468/CFSP (3) on support for activities of the Preparatory Commission of the CTBTO in the area of training and setting up, as well as strengthening the capacities of its monitoring and verification system, and in the framework of the implementation of the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction.

ANNEX
EU support for the activities of the Preparatory Commission of the CTBTO in order to strengthen its monitoring and verification capabilities and in the framework of the implementation of the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction
I. INTRODUCTION
The building up of a well-functioning monitoring and verification system of the Preparatory Commission of the CTBTO is a crucial element for preparing the implementation of the CTBT once it has entered into force. The development of capacity of the Preparatory Commission of the CTBTO in the area of noble gas monitoring is an important tool for assessing whether or not an observed explosion is a nuclear test. In addition, the operability and performance of the CTBTO monitoring and verification system depends on the contribution of all States Signatories of the CTBT. Therefore, it is important to enable States Signatories to participate and contribute fully to the CTBTO monitoring and verification system.
The proposal is built on the following two components:
(a)
noble gas monitoring;
(b)
technical assistance.
II. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECTS
1. Project Component Noble Gas Monitoring: radio-xenon measurements and data analysis to support the CTBTO in implementing the noble gas verification regime
Background
1.
The reported noble gas measurements of different teams in the aftermath of the DPRK event on 9 October 2006 have demonstrated the feasibility of radio-xenon measurements and the usefulness of these data for verification purposes. However, considerable research efforts are still necessary to fully determine the potential of this technology for CTBT purposes.
2.
The results of the ‘International Noble Gas Experiment’ (INGE) gained during the last eight years clearly showed that the radio-xenon background was much more complex than initially thought. Indeed, initially unforeseen anthropogenic sources were identified, such as radioisotope production facilities for medical applications. Some of these facilities started operating after the negotiation of the CTBT. A complete inventory of radio-xenon sources is still to be done. Correlated to this issue is the variation of the atmospheric xenon activity concentration background in location, composition and with time.
3.
Council Joint Action 2007/468/CFSP (second CTBTO Joint Action), was aimed at studying and measuring the xenon background in several parts of the world for limited periods. The aim of the second CTBTO Joint Action was to improve knowledge and understanding of the impact of sources, atmospheric transport and the influence of regional meteorological characteristics. The measurements are currently being performed at different distances of known anthropogenic sources, such as nuclear power plants and radiopharmaceutical plants. Results of the second CTBTO Joint Action will be used to further develop and validate methodologies for the categorisation of measurements detected by efficient noble gas detection systems.
Objectives of the new project
4.
As a direct follow-up to the activities undertaken under the second CTBTO Joint Action, the CTBTO is now proposing a more comprehensive global measurement campaign. This will focus on examining the influence of local radio-xenon sources on the distribution and time variability of radio-xenon concentrations. The project aims at achieving the following objectives:
—
to supplement the knowledge of the global xenon background through measurements for longer and thus more representative periods of time. This is needed to investigate the impact of regional and seasonal meteorological transport patterns.
—
to add empirical data to improve our understanding of noble gas network performance and help to understand its strengths and weaknesses, in particular how noble gas detection inter-relates with other International Monitoring System (IMS) technologies and atmospheric transport calculations. It could also provide a valuable basis for a possible implementation of noble gas monitoring capability throughout the network, as mentioned in the Protocol to the CTBT,
—
to test of xenon equipment and logistics under different environmental conditions. It is understood that available xenon measurement systems (Swedish SAUNA and French SPALAX systems) are well advanced, with the potential for transport and deployment in difficult environments. However, more experience is required to learn how and under what conditions these systems can be deployed, as well as which logistical and technical support is needed.
Benefits
5.
The benefits for the verification system will be:
—
to obtain more observations of the radio-xenon background at different distances from the measured known anthropogenic sources,
—
to obtain possible additional input for a global radio-xenon inventory,
—
to support the development as well as the validation of the methodology for data analysis and interpretation for the IMS network,
—
to further develop and validate atmospheric transport modelling at different scales and for different geographical regions,
—
to encourage and support local cooperating institutions to participate in and contribute to the INGE experiment with follow-up national xenon detection systems to train local station operators and to facilitate system commissioning,
—
to identify areas where the network performance could be affected by seasonal meteorological conditions.
Description
6.
Within the project, it is planned to purchase two xenon measurement systems, preferably using two different detection methods. The systems, one robust mobile unit and one turnkey unit customised in a transportable container, will use existing and available technologies. Parallel to the system procurement, there will be site visits to check infrastructure and to prepare the measurement campaign. The selection of the sites and the duration of the measurements will be based on detailed meteorological studies to be carried out by the Provisional Technical Secretariat (PTS) in a preparatory phase. The criteria for the site selection will also be based on the availability of cooperating local institutions, logistics and meteorological criteria. The preparation phase is envisaged to last between three and six months.
7.
After a short test operation period at headquarters, the two systems will be transported to the selected sites to measure radio-xenon for a representative period of time of 6 to 12 months. The systems will be installed, calibrated and put into operation by the system provider. Local staff will be contracted for the duration of the measurement and trained to be able to perform daily system operation and maintenance. After completion of the measurement, the systems will be returned to the PTS.
8.
Close cooperation and participation of interested institutions in the countries where the measurements are carried out in all aspects of the project implementation will be sought. In addition, the PTS will seek the cooperation with EU Member States’ institutions in specific fields, such as laboratory support, quality control, logistics and atmospheric transport studies.
9.
The data will be analysed by the PTS. A workshop will be held at the end of the project to evaluate the results.
2. Project Component Technical Assistance: Integrating States Signatories in Africa to fully participate in and contribute to the implementation of the CTBTO monitoring and verification system
Background
1.
One of the unique features of the CTBT verification system among arms control regimes is real-time provision of compliance-relevant information directly to participating States. The IMS and International Data Centre (IDC) data and products are made available to every State Signatory. Currently, the PTS provides data and products to more than 840 authorised users in 96 States Signatories.
2.
While interest among developing countries in the establishment of National Data Centres (NDC) has grown significantly over the past two years (an increase of subscribers of approximately 20 %) many developing countries still do not yet have full access to the CTBTO system. This is particularly the case in the African region where the number of States establishing National Data Centres (NDCs) as well as the number of Secure Signatory Accounts (SSAs) remains low.
3.
The proposed technical assistance activities are aimed at facilitating the improved participation by African States in the CTBT verification system and its scientific benefits. In order to be able to request data and products and to make use of them, potential users must be provided with sufficient technical background. Such background should cover the basic functionalities of the IDC and IMS as well as of the scientific applications that can be derived from the use of IMS data and IDC products. This can best be achieved through training activities over a longer period of time.
4.
The project will therefore involve the extended presence of technical experts hired by the PTS in each beneficiary State, who will serve as regional Focal Points (FPs) for the duration of this project. As feasible, targeted training and technical assistance activities will be devised for the beneficiary States in which particular needs regarding the establishment of NDCs and SSAs as well as regarding the system’s scientific benefits have been identified and assessed. Selected States Signatories in Africa which have yet to ratify the CTBT will also be involved in this project. All FP activities in beneficiary States will be carried out in close coordination with, and with support from, the PTS to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of training and technical assistance efforts undertaken in this project, as well as to ensure adequate harmonisation with the activities undertaken in Joint Action 2006/243/CFSP (first CTBTO Joint Action).
5.
Applying the abovementioned criteria, the PTS foresees, in this first phase of targeted technical assistance efforts, activities in as many of the following African States as possible, subject to a prior assessment of feasibility by the PTS taking account of local conditions prevailing at the time, and following endorsement of beneficiary countries in accordance with provisions set out under IV:
—
in Eastern and Southern Africa: Angola, Burundi, Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe,
—
in Northern and Western Africa: Algeria, Benin, Chad, Egypt, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Libya, Morocco, Togo and Tunisia.
Objectives of the project
6.
The aims of the project are to provide beneficiary States with sufficient knowledge and assistance for the building and/or improving their own NDCs’ capabilities, as well as a training programme for NDC staff. It will also include a strong component on IMS Station Operation practices. Beneficiary States will be enabled to access and use IDC data and products more easily, effectively and efficiently and to improve maintenance operations of IMS stations within their territories.
7.
It is anticipated that the interaction with FPs will facilitate an increase in the number of NDCs among beneficiary States and an enhanced participation by those States in the implementation of the CTBT monitoring and verification system, including effective and efficient use of IDC data and products. Furthermore, the project aims at strengthening the interaction and cooperation between the CTBTO and scientists and scientific institutions in those regions.
8.
An integral part of the project will involve the use of the PTS e-learning capacities developed under the first CTBTO Joint Action. It will provide a forum where participants can be instructed in the use of the e-learning products. The feedback from this process by users in the beneficiary States will have a positive influence on both the e-learning and technical assistance projects.
9.
Focusing on technical assistance, this should raise the profile of each State Signatory’s engagement with its NDC development activities undertaken by the PTS. These activities will be undertaken in furtherance of the provisions for technical assistance contained in Part I F. 22 of the Protocol to the CTBT.
Benefits
10.
The project aims to have a number of important benefits for the CTBTO and the beneficiary States, namely:
—
It will enable the NDCs in the beneficiary States to have a better qualified technical competence in:
—
the upkeep and maintenance of their IMS stations,
—
the analysis and management of the data and data products.
—
It will allow those States that establish NDCs to receive and analyse the raw data provided by the IDC in real time.
11.
States establishing NDCs will receive financial, technological and human support from the PTS, and such support will help recipient States to develop and maintain the technical expertise necessary to participate fully in the CTBT monitoring and verification system.
12.
A greater appreciation among beneficiary States of how the establishment of a NDC can help enrich their own scientific base and how IMS data can be used for analysing events in the region.
13.
Increasing the number and geographic spread of NDC sites receiving and independently analysing IDC information will allow more effective use of the IDC, thereby facilitating further improvement in system accuracy (as highlighted in the first system-wide performance test undertaken by the PTS in April-June 2005).
Description
14.
The PTS will identify and provide two technical experts as consultants serving as FPs, who will be based in Africa for the duration of this project and who will coordinate all the activities, in consultation with and under approval of IDC management. The beneficiary States will be divided into two groups between the two FPs. The work in each region will be divided into two phases.
15.
Phase 1: Technical working visits to each country:
—
The FPs will travel to the beneficiary States as described above to assess the awareness and usage of PTS data products. They will interact with national authorities, to understand the current needs and perceptions, and to increase awareness of PTS data and products, including their potential use for civil and scientific purposes. In addition, the FPs will establish contact with other relevant institutes in each country which might benefit from utilising PTS data and products. The FPs will facilitate networking between the national authority and relevant institutes as appropriate. In cases where an NDC exists, the status of each NDC in terms of personnel and infrastructure (including computer and Internet infrastructure) will be assessed, in order to formulate priority promotional activities.
—
Subsequently, a technical hands-on training session will be held, which will bring together participants from the institutions identified in this phase. This training session will provide technical instruction on PTS data and products. It will be customized based on the skill set of the participants and taking into account the official languages of the beneficiary countries. During this training session participants will work with PTS software developed for NDCs, which can be used to access and analyse PTS data and products. This software will be provided to participants (who are authorised users of the PTS) to install at their own institutes. In addition, computer hardware and peripherals will be given to participants who are authorised users of the PTS, based on their assessed needs. This session will also provide an opportunity to foster cooperation between technical staff at institutes in the region.
16.
Phase 2: Follow-up
After the completion of phase 1, the participants should be able to utilise their new knowledge, software, and hardware and to install and operate these new items based on what was learned during the training session. In order to consolidate the acquired skills and/or to close remaining gaps, the FPs will return to the beneficiary countries to assess how the participants are making use of what was learned at the training sessions in Phase 1. The objective of these shorter follow-up visits is to ensure that the local technical staff can routinely use PTS data and products. These efforts will be customised based on the local needs and skills, with an eye towards sustainability, so that the activities continue even after the conclusion of this project.
17.
As conclusion of the project, a comprehensive report will be submitted for each beneficiary country, which describes the progress made, as well as the articulated and perceived needs, and the inter-relationships between the organisations which were visited. This will form the basis for further follow-up activities in the respective countries.
III. DURATION
The total estimated duration of the implementation of the projects is 18 months.
IV. BENEFICIARIES
The beneficiaries of the projects in this Joint Action are all States Signatories to the CTBT, as well as the Preparatory Commission of the CTBTO.

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2018/1799
of 21 November 2018
on the establishment of a temporary direct statistical action for the dissemination of selected topics of the 2021 population and housing census geocoded to a 1 km2 grid
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of 11 March 2009 on European statistics and repealing Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1101/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities, Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on Community Statistics, and Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities (1), and in particular Article 14(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
The dissemination of Union-wide harmonised census topics on a constant area grid, in particular on a 1 km2 grid, is a key European statistical output for future policy-making and census strategies by the Member States.
(2)
Pursuant to Article 14(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, the Commission may decide in specific and duly justified cases, in order to meet unexpected needs, on a temporary direct statistical action which shall fulfil conditions laid down in Article 14(2) of that Regulation.
(3)
This temporary direct statistical action should provide for data collection covering one reference year. All Member States should be able to produce univariate census data geocoded to a 1 km2 grid at the reference date for the 2021 population and housing census; the Union should also make financial contributions to National Statistical Institutes and other national authorities to cover the incremental costs incurred by them. This action is supported by a cost-effectiveness analysis and an estimate of overall incremental production costs provided by the Commission.
(4)
This action is justified by a common need across the Union for reliable, accurate and comparable information on population distribution with sufficient spatial resolution, founded on harmonised output requirements and intended in particular for pan-European regional policy-making.
(5)
Harmonised, spatially resolved demographic information across the Union is available, and the objective is to disseminate one dataset per Member State, containing selected topics of the 2021 population and housing census geocoded to a 1 km2 grid. There is no additional burden on respondents as all necessary information will be obtained from the 2021 census data.
(6)
In particular, in order to achieve comparable harmonised outputs across the Union, a Union-wide constant area grid consisting of 1 km2 cells needs to be determined. Furthermore, the specific topics and their breakdowns as well as the detailed programme to be disseminated on this 1 km2 grid need to be established. Finally, it is necessary to specify the required spatial and statistical metadata for such a dataset.
(7)
Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) and related Commission Implementing Regulations lay down the required metadata (3), data format (4), and network services (5) for the dissemination of spatial data. In particular, point 1 of Annex III covers possible statistical grid systems for spatial data dissemination and, according to point 10 of Annex III, is applicable to spatial datasets under the theme ‘Population distribution — demography’.
(8)
Regulation (EC) No 763/2008 of the European Parliament and the Council (6) and related Commission Implementing Regulations establish common rules for transmission of the 2021 census data, in particular the reference year and the required metadata (7), the technical specifications of the census topics and their breakdowns (8), and the technical format (9).
(9)
Member States should transmit their validated data and metadata in electronic form, in an appropriate technical format to be provided by the Commission. The Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX) initiative on statistical and technical standards for the exchange and sharing of data and metadata, on which the Census Hub is based, was launched by the Bank of International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the Commission (Eurostat), the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United Nations and the World Bank. For the exchange of official statistics, SDMX and the Census Hub provide statistical, technical and transmission standards. A technical format in accordance with those standards should therefore be introduced.
(10)
The Commission (Eurostat) hosted a project on ‘Harmonised protection of census data in the ESS’, which delivered good practices and implementation guidelines for the harmonised disclosure protection of 1 km2 grid data.
(11)
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the European Statistical System Committee,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 834/2014
of 22 July 2014
laying down rules for the application of the common monitoring and evaluation framework of the common agricultural policy
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of 17 December 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 352/78, (EC) No 165/94, (EC) No 2799/98, (EC) No 814/2000, (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 485/2008 (1), and in particular Article 110(2) and (4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 provides for a common monitoring and evaluation framework for measuring the performance of the common agricultural policy (CAP). For the application of that framework, rules need to be laid down which ensure a comprehensive and regular assessment of the progress, effectiveness and efficiency of the CAP against objectives. In order to allow Member States and the Commission to put in place a consistent monitoring and evaluation framework, a set of common indicators as referred to in Article 110(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 should be laid down.
(2)
Those indicators should be linked to the structure and objectives of the CAP and be based on measurable elements. Therefore, different types of indicators should be laid down in order to allow for the assessment of the CAP at all levels. Impact indicators should reflect the common main objectives of the CAP as set out in Article 110(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. For each of those common main objectives more specific objectives can be identified, for which result indicators need to be laid down. Those specific objectives include farm income and farm income variability, improvement of the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, market stability, consumer expectations, provision of public goods and environmental preservation, climate change mitigation and adaptation and maintenance of a diverse agriculture, as well as the specific objectives defined for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), namely the Union priorities for rural development. In addition, the practical implementation of the CAP instruments should be monitored on the basis of output indicators that are able to reflect this operational level of the CAP.
(3)
It is important to ensure that the monitoring and evaluation framework can be used by Member States and the Commission efficiently and at the appropriate time. It should therefore be provided that Member States send the information necessary for the monitoring and evaluation of the CAP within the deadlines set by the relevant Regulations. With a view to avoiding any undue administrative burden, the Commission should, to the extent possible, use information already made available to it,
(4)
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Agricultural Funds,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
